    "Still working on the Invisible Canon. Today I want to find a superset of canons for fiction: not genre fiction, but \"literature\". Of course, the Stanford Literary Lab has already done work on this. In their *Pamphlet 8: Between Canon and Corpus* they demonstrate that overlaying different \"top 100 books of the 20th century\" lists leads to significant overlap, and can be used to triangulate a sort of \"most voted for\" list. They use six different lists and end up with roughly 400 unique books. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can use this \"found canon\" technique to craft a data feature, something like \"number of times this work has been canonized\". That's useful in its own right, but it could also be the target for a collaborative filtering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to extract that information from a bunch of HTML tables and PDF reports, because academics. And then map it to the features from my previous distillation. One problem that will arise is that goodreads data is sorted by edition, while the canon lists are sorted by work. So the first problem is to reshape the data. Pandas provides MultiIndex, a way of stacking data in multiple dimensions. let's try that"
