    "This notebook is generated with the [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) framework. Fastpages allows me to write my posts in Jupyter notebooks. That means I can include my code and the actual results it outputs, right on the page. Under the hood, fastpages converts `.ipynb` notebook files into markdown files, and passes those to the Jekyll static site generator. Jekyll is written in Ruby, which I don't know very well, but it was one of the first popular static site generators and it has strong integration with Github, so I've gotten pretty familiar with it over the years. I wrote a few custom modules on top of fastpages, in Liquid and HTML, but mostly left the site uncustomized. On the previous version of my website I spent a lot of time customizing JSX and not enough time posting. I now correct that trend.\n",
