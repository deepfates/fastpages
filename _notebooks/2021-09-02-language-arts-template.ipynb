    "To display those in the `fastpages` framework I need to make markdown files for each of the projects, with its own date and description, and a list of image tags to display. Also a header image and video tags for any interpolation videos. And of course I'll need to copy some images over from the folder itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a template string has worked so far, for generating markdown folders. I can't do it entirely programmatically because I want to insert relevant comments for each one as I recall them. And I want to hand select the images, so I don't just copy over a bunch of crappy early-epoch training images. Probably the best way to do this is to hcopy images for each GAN project to subfolder of `images` with its name, then use a function of the folder name and manually-added metadata to build a markdown file over the contents of the folder. There are only so many projects I've built, and the marginal cost for adding a new one will be small if I can re-use the function."
