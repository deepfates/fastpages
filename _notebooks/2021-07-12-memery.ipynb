    "For years I was frustrated every time I tried to find an image on my hard drive: a meme to send to a friend, a photo of an important moment, a screenshot of a relevant quote. No matter how organized your folders, a hierarchical tree just can't capture all the dimensions of an image collection. And once you've found the right folder, your filenames better be easy to remember, or you still have to scan visually through hundreds of images.\n",
