<pre>[&#39;I spent three years living at an anarchist to find out if people could live without oppressive social structures. here are some things I learned&#39;,
 &#39;personally I think this is a great idea  https://t.co/VaHFyrg28C&#39;,
 &#34;stop taking your fucking shopping cart back to the store. Don&#39;t even put it in that little corral thing. You got to leave shopping carts all over the parking lot. the best part of working at a grocery store is collecting shopping carts, alone, in the parking lot. don&#39;t fuck it up&#34;,
 &#39;are these &#34;ideas&#34; in the room with us now?  https://t.co/mJ214Pl57X&#39;,
 &#39; https://t.co/rRaOXnNxKI&#39;,
 &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as the marketplace of ideas. ideas are alive.   there is ecology of an ideas&#34;,
 &#39;rt 🔒  https://t.co/TkgYsUJfCE&#39;,
 &#34;you&#39;re telling me carbon made these lifeforms based?&#34;,
 &#39;how is this a real book??  https://t.co/VwIgG8yVTU&#39;,
 &#34;(how do primitivists change a lightbulb? they don&#39;t. they just light the room with their laptop screens)&#34;,
 &#39; https://t.co/zNcAbWhSrt&#39;,
 &#39;Within 10-20 years, nearly every branch of computer science will be, for all intents and purposes, a branch of magic.  Computational illusion, comp enchantment, comp sorcery, comp summoning... Even comp enlightenment. Impossible simulations, non-Euclidean data analysis, telepathy&#39;,
 &#39;found on hard drive  https://t.co/B61IXJAQvV&#39;,
 &#39;why did you send me this  https://t.co/hgu2ddpqHG&#39;,
 &#39;how old were you when you found out  https://t.co/XMb2pgGKIw&#39;,
 &#39;a lot of people will tell you to &#34;empty your mind&#34;. this is a trap.   they want to store things in there&#39;,
 &#39;if you\&#39;re still thinking your politics as &#34;left-wing&#34; or &#34;right-wing\&#39; I regret to inform you that the plane has no wings and also no one is flying it and also it\&#39;s falling&#39;,
 &#39;yesterday a real tall stoned looking dude come in my bookstore. he saw our magic books through the window and had to compliment them.  &#34;Do you even know what you have here?&#34; he said. &#34;This is the Real Shit right here. What is this, an arms dealership?&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; https://t.co/CdKyG6rcnX&#39;,
 &#39;wyd after smoking this?  https://t.co/ZClIqCOkmA&#39;,
 &#39;we need a new word for the kind of dizzy, nauseous feeling you get after spending hours looking at synthetic media.  GAN art, GPT outputs, deepfake videos, LSTM music: they all have a certain uncanny valley affect in common, and it does a weird thing to you&#39;,
 &#39;I always hoped one day my life would look like this  https://t.co/2jJOtRYXbY&#39;,
 &#39;2) hierarchies and in-group/outgroup dynamics are probably hardwired in humans. if you attempt to suppress them, they will become invisible, and then you can\&#39;t even talk about them. This is well covered terrain, &#34;tyranny of structurelessness material&#34;, but it hurts to see it irl&#39;,
 &#39;please do not tap on the glass. it scares the tweets&#39;,
 &#39;once you accept that you are part of a giant time-binding hyperorganism called &#34;society&#34; or whatever, you can align yourself with the processes around you.   instead of living dependent on yet hostile to the hive, convincing yourself that it\&#39;s Chaotic Good because Society is Evil&#39;,
 &#39;do they, though?  do they ask that  https://t.co/hN8DV4sM4d&#39;,
 &#34;I think it&#39;s hilarious that there are tons of NGO people out there trying to figure out how we&#39;re going to reinvent schooling and spending 40 hours a week talking with each other about it.   meanwhile I know teenagers on Twitter who are doing their homework with GPT-3 🤣&#34;,
 &#34;the paradox of tolerance is when you can&#39;t get high anymore because you get high too often&#34;,
 &#39;oh no 🤦🤦🤦 post rats are doing memes  https://t.co/oiyVn60s64&#39;,
 &#34;eat a mushroom for God&#39;s sake. Human beings did not get to be the most intelligent species on this planet by eating powders and pills&#34;,
 &#34;sometimes i wish i could just enjoy my life. i feel so much pressure: to create, to build the things i imagine. i feel like there&#39;s not enough time: in the day, the week, the weekends. in my life.   i don&#39;t understand how people just... consume experiences&#34;,
 &#39;there\&#39;s a popular belief that goes something like:  🗣️ &#34;Things are very bad in the world and you personally have the power to stop them! and if you don\&#39;t try, you\&#39;re complicit in the badness!&#34;  and i just don\&#39;t think the evidence supports it&#39;,
 &#34;hey if you didn&#39;t know yet there&#39;s going to be a WORLDWIDE COFFEE BEAN SHORTAGE this year. You might want to go stock up on Bean. This is not a drill I would not lie to you about coffee.   ❤️ to my friends who don&#39;t keep tabs on global infrastructure&#34;,
 &#39;maybe the real reason people are afraid of GPT3 is it reveals their own so-called intelligence to be a parlor trick  https://t.co/QLFUyrbf73&#39;,
 &#39;the trick to budgeting is to make more money, not spend less&#39;,
 &#34;type of guy who becomes enlightened but doesn&#39;t feel the need to tell anybody about it, he just uses it to make better dumb tweets&#34;,
 &#39;yeah, I have a &#34;colorblind&#34; dating policy. I don\&#39;t see red flags&#39;,
 &#39;technically a pushup is an upside down bench press of the entire planet&#39;,
 &#39;groups of young people should take over old infrastructure and make it their own. people should fall in love, and feud, and have epic stories. there is meaning in it.  we just have to not fall for our own narratives&#39;,
 &#39;The more I learn about how software is built, the more amazed I am that any software is ever built at all&#39;,
 &#34;Help, my brainworms are producing the\xa0Spice Melange, commonly referred to simply as &#39;the spice&#39;, a naturally produced\xa0awareness spectrum narcotic\xa0that formed a fundamental block of commerce and technological development in the\xa0known universe\xa0for millennia&#34;,
 &#34;pro tip: if you&#39;re giving someone a book at a gift, write them a nice note on the first page with the date and your signature. trust me&#34;,
 &#39;The overlap between psychedelics culture and AI culture is not a coincidence&#39;,
 &#39;human beings are totally insects. we make hives, paths, territory. we have war and social stratification and complex communication patterns.   you may have heard of this documetary, Antz,,   https://t.co/Z4VdLehmJw&#39;,
 &#34;but!  7) modern agriculture is pretty fucked up, as are cities. we should make them all ecological. and we should rewild the suburbs  because nothing hurts like the suburbs, once you&#39;ve been in the wilderness a while&#34;,
 &#34;i live in the city now because it&#39;s like a ten minute walk to the food store where somebody has already made food supplies that i can literally buy with money i worked for at something i&#39;m good at and enjoy.   people do cities for a reason. LARPers know this but don&#39;t admit&#34;,
 &#39;because...  6) autonomy is an illusion  i think Americans especially have this DIY ethos that is admirable and stupid at the same time. everybody is told that inventors and revolutionaries are the heroes of history. so they keep re-inventing the wheel  the heinlein quote is wrong  https://t.co/Uro3cV0wPX&#39;,
 &#39;1) arable land is expensive, farming requires a lot of land, growing all your own food is basically impossible unless you want to spend literally all your time doing it.   we grew a lot of fresh veg but got our staples with food stamps or cash&#39;,
 &#39;work is HARD WORK. doing things yourself, the long way, is a pain in the ass.  i think it is GOOD to do it,  and i would like it if there were a program you could go instead of college where you just go do hard work and live a low-energy life so you appreciate the GOD DAMN CITY&#39;,
 &#39;people on this website have no fucking gravitas&#39;,
 &#39;gf has been gone for a week. The house is a war zone. I have 4 hours to clean up before picking her up at the airport.  wish me luck&#39;,
 &#39;4) a network of permanent autonomous zones is a hard thing to protect  the temporary autonomous zone -- like Rainbow Gathering, or Burning Man, or OWS -- appears and disappears, shifts and transforms in location and composition over time.  a permanent zone is a sitting duck&#39;,
 &#34;Tell me you&#39;re hot, without telling me you&#39;re hot&#34;,
 &#39;People talk about this side of Twitter or this corner of Twitter  what shape is Twitter?&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;former gifted kids&#34; check your privilege. Don\&#39;t want to hear from you today.  Where\&#39;s my former juvenile delinquents at??&#39;,
 &#39;it takes roughly 10 acres of farmland to support a single person for a year, including grains and animals and everything. maybe you can get that down a little with permaculture technique and wildcrafting.  we had one and a half acres of meadow&#39;,
 &#34;gf is replacing the busted elastic string in the tent poles with new, functional elastic string.   i didn&#39;t know you could do this. this is the hottest thing i&#39;ve ever seen&#34;,
 &#34;you can&#39;t, of course. anyone can do the math on this, but most people won&#39;t. especially the primitivists. they prefer their narrative over reality. they eat the food that other people get from town. i don&#39;t know how they get over this cognitive dissonance, but they&#39;re good at it&#34;,
 &#34;and to get all that food, without much arable land, requires you to go to town. and it takes gasoline to go to town, and to get back. so you&#39;re always going to town.   we would regularly spend 6+ hours in the car and 8+ hours doing errands in a town 100 miles away. sustainable?&#34;,
 &#39;oops, first message should read &#34;at an anarchist commune&#34;* but too late now  anyway it was a semi-restored ghost town in the middle of the national forest, 13 miles of dirt and 60 miles of 1lane highway to a gas station  i\&#39;ve written about it before here  https://t.co/K34IutWfLd&#39;,
 &#39;but to get all that wood required a bunch of hippies to get in the pickup, drive up the mountain, fell trees with chainsaw, buck and throw the wood and come back and chop it all to size. so you need a bunch of gasoline and food to get wood. &#34;hippie power&#34; is food-based energy&#39;,
 &#34;3) energy is expensive.  when i arrived there was just a DIY Pelton wheel, which is a micro-hydro generator built with a car alternator  me and friends installed some solar panels (we peer-pressured a visitor from NYC to buy them for us)  and then there&#39;s wood&#34;,
 &#39;some people would argue that this was all immoral and that we should eat only what we grew on the land and cut all the wood with a crosscut saw (the old-timey one that has a person on either end), aka the &#34;misery whip&#34;  but then, where do you get the food to give you energy?&#39;,
 &#34;who&#39;s got three thumbs and access to the openai beta  👍👍👍 this guy&#34;,
 &#39;there are so many ghost towns in America. there will be so many more, soon. it is good for small groups of people to come together and try different things.  and i think i learned more in my 20s than people who went to college 🤔&#39;,
 &#39;a real &#34;permanent autonomous zone&#34; is like the Zapatista municipalities in Chiapas, or the Kurds in Rojava. you want autonomy? simple. defend yourself against every sovereign power that claims power over you.   how you gonna do that at the peacenik commune? u have like one gun&#39;]</pre>
