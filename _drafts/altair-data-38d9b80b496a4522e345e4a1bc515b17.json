Luckily, kindhearted Eli knows just where to turn.\nWhen Eli asks former Marine Brick Hunter to help, Brick isn't sure he wants to get involved. But Brick has worked through his own PTSD, and like it or not, he owes Eli a favor. With Cody struggling to rejoin the real world and Brick agreeing to take him in, they discover they have more in common than either of them thought possible.\nThough Cody tries to stay in the here and now, he sometimes flashes to unexplainable traumatic events-events that don't fit his usual war zone delusions. As the \"delusions\" grow more frequent, it becomes apparent they might not be delusions at all. Cody may have actually witnessed a murder.","title_az":"Love Means...

With all of the planet's easily accessible resource deposits rapidly approaching exhaustion, the desperate hunt for supplies has become a frenzy of extreme exploration, as governments and corporations rush to stake their claim in areas previously considered too dangerous and remote. The Race for What's Lefttakes us from the Arctic to war zones to deep ocean floors, from a Russian submarine planting the country's flag on the North Pole seabed to the large-scale buying up of African farmland by Saudi Arabia, China, and other food-importing nations.\nAs Klare explains, this invasion of the final frontiers carries grave consequences. With resource extraction growing more complex, the environmental risks are becoming increasingly severe; the Deepwater Horizondisaster is only a preview of the dangers to come. At the same time, the intense search for dwindling supplies is igniting new border disputes, raising the likelihood of military confrontation. Inevitably, if the scouring of the globe continues on its present path, many key resources that modern industry relies upon will disappear completely. The only way out, Klare argues, is to alter our consumption patterns altogether--a crucial task that will be the greatest challenge of the coming century.","title_az":"The Race for What's Left: The Global Scramble for the World's Last Resources","rank":676646.0,"category":"Politics&amp;Government"},{"isbn":"0970190719","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Tree","author_name":"Dana   Lyons","top_genre":"picture-books","publisher":"Illumination Arts Publishing Company","publication_year":2002.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":32.0,"average_rating":4.06,"ratings_count":27.0,"text_reviews_count":11.0,"description":"There is a river flowing near me, and I?ve watched that river change and grow.

Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) allow organizations to manage and back up huge file systems quickly, thereby keeping their lifeblood flowing. W. Curtis Preston's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of building and managing large data centers using SANs and NAS.\nAs a network administrator you're aware that multi-terabyte data stores are common and petabyte data stores are starting to appear. Given this much data, how do you ensure that it is available all the time, that access times and throughput are reasonable, and that the data can be backed up and restored in a timely manner? SANs and NAS provide solutions that help you work through these problems, with special attention to the difficulty of backing up huge data stores.\nThis book explains the similarities and differences of SANs and NAS to help you determine which, or both, of these complementing technologies are appropriate for your network. Using SANs, for instance, is a way to share multiple devices (tape drives and disk drives) for storage, while NAS is a means for centrally storing files so they can be shared. Preston exams each technology with a vendor neutral approach, starting with the building blocks of a SAN and how they can be assembled for effective storage solutions. He covers day-to-day management and backup and recovery for both SANs and NAS in detail.\nWhether you're a seasoned storage administrator or a network administrator charged with taking on this role, you'll find all the information you need to make informed architecture and data management decisions. The book fans out to explore technologies such as RAID and other forms of monitoring that will help complement your data center. With an eye on the future, other technologies that might affect the architecture and management of the data center are explored. This is sure to be an essential volume in any network administrator's or storage administrator's library.","title_az":"Using SANs and NAS","rank":1950696.0,"category":"Networking&amp;CloudComputing"},{"isbn":"0985022302","asin":null,"title_gr":"Human Resources","author_name":"Geoffrey Neil","top_genre":"mystery","publisher":"Priorities Intact Publishing","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":282.0,"average_rating":3.52,"ratings_count":113.0,"text_reviews_count":32.0,"description":"Human Resources has been optioned for film or TV adaptation by Mace Neufeld Productions, producers of The Omen, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Invictus and a list of other titles.\nSome things are much worse than getting fired.

He intended it, prepared for it, chose the moment for launching it, planned its course, and, on several occasions between 1939 and 1942, claimed to have won it.\nAlthough the aims he sought to achieve were old nationalist aspirations, the fact that the policy and strategy for their realization were imposed so completely by Hitler meant that if victory had come, it would have been very much a personal triumph: the ultimate failure was thus a personal one too.\nThis book presents all of Hitler's directives, from preparations for the invasion of Poland (31 August 1939) to his last desperate order to his troops on the Eastern Front (15 April 1945), whom he urges to choke the Bolshevik assault 'in a bath of blood'. They provide a fascinating insight into Hitler's mind and how he interpreted and reacted to events as they unfolded.

But, what happened to the fairest, noblest, and finest profession that de la Vega saw?\nDe la Vega hit on an essential truth that has been forgotten: finance can be just as principled, life-affirming, and worthyas it can be fraught with questionable practices. Today, finance is shrouded in mystery for outsiders, while many insiders are uneasy with the disrepute of their profession. How can finance become more accessible and also recover its nobility?\nHarvard Business School professor Mihir Desai, in his \"last lecture\" to the graduating Harvard MBA class of 2015, took up the cause of restoring humanity to finance. With incisive wit and irony, his lecture drew upon a rich knowledge of literature, film, history, and philosophy to explain the inner workings of finance in a manner that has never been seen before.\nThis book captures Desai's lucid exploration of the ideas of finance as seen through the unusual prism of the humanities. Through this novel, creative approach, Desai shows that outsiders can access the underlying ideas easily and insiders can reacquaint themselves with the core humanity of their profession.\nThe mix of finance and the humanities creates unusual pairings: Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are guides to risk management; Jeff Koons becomes an advocate of leverage; and Mel Brooks's The Producersteaches us about fiduciary responsibility. In Desai's vision, the principles of finance also provide answers to critical questions in our lives. Among many surprising parallels, bankruptcy teaches us how to react to failure, the lessons of mergers apply to marriages, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model demonstrates the true value of relationships.\nTHE WISDOM OF FINANCE is a wholly unique book, offering a refreshing new perspective on one of the world's most complex and misunderstood professions.","title_az":"The Wisdom of Finance: Discovering Humanity in the World of Risk and Return","rank":54741.0,"category":"Economics"},{"isbn":"1599218836","asin":null,"title_gr":"Creative Is a Verb: If You're Alive, You're Creative","author_name":"Patti Digh","top_genre":"creativity","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.18,"ratings_count":292.0,"text_reviews_count":21.0,"description":"Following up on her successful Life Is a Verb, and in the tradition of Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way, Patti Digh here presents a book that leads readers by both heart and head to acknowledge, reinforce, and use their own creative spirit.

In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter. The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna forced him into underpaid work as a labourer. During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery. After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party. In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous Munich \"Beer-hall putsch\" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested. During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf, the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign. In Mein Kampf, Hitler describes his strategy for rebuilding Germany and conquering Europe. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who destabilized world peace and pursued the genocide now known as the Holocaust. \"...

You should not expect to develop dementia as you grow older. The brain is fully capable of functioning normally for a lifetime, regardless of how long a person lives. While aging is a risk factor for neurodegeneration, it is not the cause! Dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders are disease processes that can be prevented and successfully treated. This book outlines a program that is backed by decades of medical and clinical research that has proven successful in restoring mental function and improving both brain and overall health. You will learn how to prevent and even reverse symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, epilepsy, diabetes, stroke, and various forms of dementia. The information in this book is useful not only for those who are suffering from neurodegenerative disease, but for anyone who wants to be spared from encountering these devastating afflictions. These diseases don t just happen overnight. They take years, often decades, to develop. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, approximately 70 percent the brain cells responsible for memory are destroyed before symptoms become noticeable. Once symptoms surface, the brain is already in an advanced stage of degeneration. You do not want to wait until most of your brain has died before you start to do something about it. You can stop Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases before they take over your life, but you must start now.","title_az":"Stop Alzheimer's Now!: How to Prevent &amp; Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis &amp; Other Neurodegenerative Disorders","rank":162035.0,"category":"Medicine"},{"isbn":"097866213X","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Memoir of Marilyn Monroe","author_name":"Sandi Gelles-Cole","top_genre":"fiction","publisher":"Gelles-Cole Literary Enterprises","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":154.0,"average_rating":2.23,"ratings_count":12.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"\"My so-called death scene is always described the same: My housekeeper, Eunice Murray, finds my wasted, naked body tangled in a sheet, wet from secretions better left unexplained.

This new volume by distinguished historian Stanley G. Payne draws on his half-century of experience to offer a balanced, broadly chronological survey of Spanish history from the Visigoths to the present. Who were the first \"Spaniards\"? Is Spain a fully Western country? Was Spanish liberalism a failure? Examining Spain's unique role in the larger history of Western Europe, Payne reinterprets key aspects of the country's history.\nTopics include Muslim culture in the peninsula, the Spanish monarchy, the empire, and the relationship between Spain and Portugal. Turning to the twentieth century, Payne discusses the Second Republic and the Spanish Civil War. The book's final chapters focus on the Franco regime, the nature of Spanish fascism, and the special role of the military. Analyzing the figure of Franco himself, Payne seeks to explain why some Spaniards still regard him with respect, while many others view the late dictator with profound loathing.\nFramed by reflections on the author's own formation as a Hispanist and his evaluation of the controversy about \"historical memory\" in contemporary Spain, this volume offers deeply informed insights into both the history and the historiography of a unique country.\nAChoice Outstanding Academic Book\nBest Books for General Audiences, selected by the Public Library Association","title_az":"Spain: A Unique History","rank":1302607.0,"category":"Politics&Government"},{"isbn":"1490371362","asin":null,"title_gr":"Connecting to the Legacy!: Learn the Ethical and Spiritual Concerns of Jesus and His Disciples","author_name":"Celso Cukierkorn","top_genre":"by-the-bed-site","publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":194.0,"average_rating":4.75,"ratings_count":3.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"The last supper is how we were conditioned to see this image.

Madame Aubain had married a comely youth without any money, who died in the beginning of 1809, leaving her with two young children and a number of debts. She sold all her property excepting the farm of Toucques and the farm of Geffosses, the income of which barely amounted to 5,000 francs; then she left her house in Saint-Melaine, and moved into a less pretentious one which had belonged to her ancestors and stood back of the market-place. This house, with its slate-covered roof, was built between a passage-way and a narrow street that led to the river. The interior was so unevenly graded that it caused people to stumble. A narrow hall separated the kitchen from the parlour, where Madame Aubain sat all day in a straw armchair near the window. Eight mahogany chairs stood in a row against the white wainscoting. An old piano, standing beneath a barometer, was covered with a pyramid of old books and boxes. On either side of the yellow marble mantelpiece, in Louis XV. style, stood a tapestry armchair. The clock represented a temple of Vesta; and the whole room smelled musty, as it was on a lower level than the garden.","title_az":"A Simple Soul","rank":16023138.0,"category":"Humanities"},{"isbn":"1900850575","asin":null,"title_gr":"Bar Flaubert","author_name":"Alexis Stamatis","top_genre":"greek-literature","publisher":"Arcadia Books","publication_year":2007.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":287.0,"average_rating":4.03,"ratings_count":160.0,"text_reviews_count":7.0,"description":"Both a search for identity and an intriguing family saga, this tale follows the journey--filled with love, denial, and danger--undertaken by a young man who tries to discover why a novel by an aspiring writer seems to echo his own innermost thoughts.

O'Connor, a young reporter with the \"Las Piernas News Express,\" is desperate to discover who has perpetrated a savage attack on his mentor, Jack Corrigan. In and out of consciousness, Corrigan claims to have witnessed the burial of a bloodstained car on a farm, but his reputation as a heavy drinker calls his strange story into question. In a seemingly unrelated mystery, a yacht bearing four members of the wealthy Ducane family disappears during a storm off the coast. An investigation finds that the Ducane home has been broken into; a nursemaid has been killed; and Max, the infant heir, has gone missing. Corrigan recovers his health, but despite a police investigation and his own tireless inquiries, the mysteries of the buried car and the whereabouts of Maxwell Ducane haunt him until his death. Twenty years after that fateful night, in her first days as a novice reporter working for managing editor O'Connor, Irene Kelly covers the groundbreaking ceremony for a shopping center -- which unexpectedly yields the unearthing of a buried car. In the trunk are human remains. Are those of the infant heir among them? If so, who is the young man who has recently changed his name to Max Ducane? Again the trail goes maddeningly, perhaps suspiciously, cold.\nUntil today. Irene, now married to homicide detective Frank Harriman, is a veteran reporter facing the impending closing of the \"Las Piernas News Express.\" With circulation down and young reporters fresh out of journalism school replacing longtime staffers, Irene can't help but wish for the good old days when she worked with O'Connor. So when the baffling kidnap-burial case resurfaces, Irene's tenacious love for her mentorand journalistic integrity far outweigh any fears or trepidation.

Eddie is a hyperactive, difficult child, both boon companion and bane of Danny's existence. Meanwhile, Nancy's helpful, neighborly relationship with Eddie's father, Frank, becomes a passionate affair. Frank is the partner Nancy wishes she had, and the father Danny has always longed for. Then one day, Eddie brings over a hunting bow and playfully aims it at Danny and his dog. In a tragic mishap, Danny accidentally shoots and kills his friend.\nThe novel traces the repercussions of that accident--in Nancy's voice, in Danny's voice, and from Frank's point of view. Danny's extraordinary account of the events that led up to the action is a heartbreaking, pitch-perfect record of the complications of love, the weight of isolation, and the ultimate opacity of intention and motivation. How Nancy's fierce, enduring love for her son sustains a future for him and how Frank's devastating loss and guilt play into that future provide drama-tic counterpoint to Danny's painful dissection of what he has done.\nWith stunning imagination and an almost sculptural elegance of storytelling, Maxine Cher-noff balances the radical shock of tragedy with the hard-won optimism of survival. She brilliantly enacts how a child stunned by grief and the adults who love him reclaim their trust in the future. Ultimately, A Boy in Wintertestifies to the power of parental love and steadfast friendship to provide hope and faith in the face of tragedy.","title_az":"A Boy in Winter","rank":3316807.0,"category":"UnitedStates"},{"isbn":"1478740817","asin":null,"title_gr":"Sacred Cows: A Lighthearted Look at Belief and Tradition Around the World","author_name":"Seth Andrews","top_genre":"humor","publisher":"Outskirts Press","publication_year":2015.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":212.0,"average_rating":3.91,"ratings_count":14.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"Did you know God forbids the tying of shoelaces on Saturday?

Along the way, he pledges to marry the daughter of Lord Walder Frey in exchange for a military advantage that allows him to capture Jaime Lannister--a powerful bargaining chip to ensure Lord Eddard's safe release. But it is one thing to capture the Kingslayer and quite another to hold him.\nMeanwhile, in King's Landing, young King Joffrey has other ideas than an exchange of prisoners. Ignoring the advice of his mother, Queen Cersei, he throws oil on the flames of conflict and ignites a conflagration that seems likely to consume not only the Starks but all of Westeros--unless Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, can bring the mad boy-king to heel.\nBeyond the Wall, greater dangers are brewing, as a winter as brutal as any in history approaches, bringing with it unnatural creatures out of legend. There, Eddard's bastard, Jon Snow, must decide once and for all where his loyalties lie.\nAnd across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen will learn the true measure of grief--and emerge from its fiery depths transformed, hardened, and ready to claim what is hers by right: the Iron Throne.","title_az":"A Game of Thrones: The Graphic Novel: Volume Four","rank":46021.0,"category":"GraphicNovels"},{"isbn":"0736816844","asin":null,"title_gr":"ABC Under the Sea: An Ocean Life Alphabet Book","author_name":"Barbara Knox","top_genre":"alexandia-s-books","publisher":"Capstone","publication_year":2003.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":32.0,"average_rating":3.8,"ratings_count":10.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"Provides an introduction to ocean creatures by using each letter of the alphabet.","title_az":"ABC Under the Sea: An Ocean Life Alphabet Book (Alphabet Books)","rank":3886029.0,"category":"Animals"},{"isbn":"1626728143","asin":null,"title_gr":"Arlo Finch in the Valley of Fire","author_name":"John August","top_genre":"middle-grade","publisher":"Roaring Brook Press","publication_year":2018.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":336.0,"average_rating":4.4,"ratings_count":10.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"The first book in a spellbinding fantasy adventure series so believable you may wonder if it's happening in your own backyard.\nAs Arlo looked around, the walls of his room began to vanish, revealing a moonlit forest.

Much more than a traditional military history, it is an account of the excitement of becoming a pilot and flying in combat over the Western Front, told through the words and voices of the aviators themselves.\nA World War II pilot himself, the memoirist and critic Samuel Hynes revives the adventurous young men who inspired his own generation to take to the sky. The volunteer fliers were often privileged-the sorts of college athletes and Ivy League students who might appear in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, and sometimes did. Others were country boys from the farms and ranches of the West. Hynes follows them from the flying clubs of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale and the grass airfields of Texas and Canada to training grounds in Europe and on to the front, where they learned how to fight a war in the air. And to the bars and clubs of Paris and London, where they unwound and discovered another kind of excitement, another challenge. He shows how East Coast aristocrats like Teddy Roosevelt's son Quentin and Arizona roughnecks like Frank Luke the Balloon Buster all dreamed of chivalric single combat in the sky, and how they came to know both the beauty of flight and the constant presence of death.\nBy drawing on letters sent home, diaries kept, and memoirs published in the years that followed, Hynes brings to life the emotions, anxieties, and triumphs of the young pilots. They gasp in wonder at the world seen from a plane, struggle to keep their hands from freezing in open air cockpits, party with actresses and aristocrats, rest at Voltaire's castle, and search for their friends' bodies on the battlefield. Their romantic war becomes more than that-a harsh but often thrilling reality.

These manuals seldom go beyond teaching how to avoid the problems of punctuation, grammar, and style that at one time or another ensnare the best of writers. Few, if any, of these books explore writing as a way of shaping thought.\nV.A. Howard and J.H. Barton, two Harvard researchers in education, take a radically different approach. While they agree with their predecessors that an important function of writing is the clear, direct expression of thought, they point out that many of our thoughts first come into being only when put to paper. By failing to recognize the link between thinking and writing, we fall into the deadlock innappropriately named writer's block.\nThinking on Paper shows how writer's block as well as many other writing problems are engendered by the tendency, supported by traditional approaches, to separate thinking from writing. Drawing on the developing field of symbol theory, Howard and Barton explain why this sepapration is unsound and demonstrate how to improve dramatically our ability to generate and express ideas. For everyone who writes, this is a readable, accessible manual of immense educational and practical value.","title_az":"Thinking on Paper","rank":887658.0,"category":"Research&amp;PublishingGuides"},{"isbn":"0226183998","asin":null,"title_gr":"Constructing the Political Spectacle","author_name":"Murray Edelman","top_genre":"politics","publisher":"University Of Chicago Press","publication_year":1988.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":142.0,"average_rating":3.82,"ratings_count":65.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"Thanks to the ready availability of political news today, informed citizens can protect and promote their own interests and the public interest more effectively.

By day she deals with the topsy-turvy logic and ingrown personalities at work in high finance; by night she has to watch the slow disintegration of the man she loves. In between, she must stop herself from falling apart. Friendship with Mike, a colleague and incognito socialist, helps her survive the assault course of the workplace with its vicious office politics. But as the money markets hurtle towards financial meltdown, Cath faces personal disaster and a moral hazard that she cannot ignore.

It is our twenty-first century New World; its explorers robots, shipped 350 million miles from Earth to uncover the distant planet's secrets.\nIts most recent scout is Curiosity--a one-ton, Jeep-sized nuclear-powered space laboratory--which is now roving the Martian surface to determine whether the red planet has ever been physically capable of supporting life. In Red Rover, geochemist Roger Wiens, the principal investigator for the ChemCam laser instrument on the rover and veteran of numerous robotic NASA missions, tells the unlikely story of his involvement in sending sophisticated hardware into space, culminating in the Curiosity rover's amazing journey to Mars.\nIn so doing, Wiens paints the portrait of one of the most exciting scientific stories of our time: the new era of robotic space exploration. Starting with NASA's introduction of the Discovery Program in 1992, scrappier, more nimble missions became the order of the day, as manned missions were confined to Earth orbit, and behemoth projects went extinct. This strategic shift presented huge scientific opportunities, but tight budgets meant that success depended more than ever on creative engineering and human ingenuity. Beginning with the Genesis mission that launched his career, Wiens describes the competitive, DIY spirit of these robotic enterprises, from conception to construction, from launch to heart-stopping crashes and smooth landings.\nAn inspiring account of the real-life challenges of space exploration, Red Rovervividly narrates what goes into answering the question: is there life elsewhere in the universe?","title_az":"Red Rover: Inside the Story of Robotic Space Exploration, from Genesis to the Mars Rover Curiosity","rank":619427.0,"category":"Engineering"},{"isbn":"0465032923","asin":null,"title_gr":"Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used and Abused in the Courtroom","author_name":"Leila Schneps","top_genre":"science","publisher":"Basic Books","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":272.0,"average_rating":3.51,"ratings_count":160.0,"text_reviews_count":19.0,"description":"In the wrong hands, math can be deadly. Even the simplest numbers can become powerful forces when manipulated by politicians or the media, but in the case of the law, your liberty--and your life--can depend on the right calculation.\nIn Math on Trial, mathematicians Leila Schneps and Coralie Colmez describe ten trials spanning from the nineteenth century to today, in which mathematical arguments were used--and disastrously misused--as evidence. They tell the stories of Sally Clark, who was accused of murdering her children by a doctor with a faulty sense of calculation; of nineteenth-century tycoon Hetty Green, whose dispute over her aunt's will became a signal case in the forensic use of mathematics; and of the case of Amanda Knox, in which a judge's misunderstanding of probability led him to discount critical evidence--which might have kept her in jail. Offering a fresh angle on cases from the nineteenth-century Dreyfus affair to the murder trial of Dutch nurse Lucia de Berk, Schneps and Colmez show how the improper application of mathematical concepts can mean the difference between walking free and life in prison.\nA colorful narrative of mathematical abuse, Math on Trialblends courtroom drama, history, and math to show that legal expertise isn't always enough to prove a person innocent.","title_az":"Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used and Abused in the Courtroom","rank":506356.0,"category":"Mathematics"},{"isbn":"0880014121","asin":null,"title_gr":"Reckless Appetites: A Culinary Romance","author_name":"Jacqueline Deval","top_genre":"fiction","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.39,"ratings_count":48.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":null,"title_az":"Reckless Appetites: A Culinary Romance","rank":3440362.0,"category":"Contemporary"},{"isbn":"0688167187","asin":null,"title_gr":"Cornflakes: Poems","author_name":"James Stevenson","top_genre":"poetry","publisher":"Greenwillow Books","publication_year":2000.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":56.0,"average_rating":3.71,"ratings_count":34.0,"text_reviews_count":14.0,"description":"Want to savor something really delicious?

But soon he was transforming the way the team played, melding the famous English defensive spine of Adams, Keown, Dixon, Winterburn and Seaman with a hugely creative foreign attacking spirit, epitomised by Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires. At the same time, he introduced new ideas on diet, fitness and professionalism, which many players believe extended their careers.\nHaving won numerous trophies, and led the Invincibles to an unbeaten league season in 2003-04, Wenger then had to help the club through the next stage of their development when they moved from Highbury to the Emirates. Despite the financial constraints he faced, he still managed to keep the club playing in the Champions League year after year while remaining true to his philosophy of how the game should be played. Furthermore, he once again began to build a trophy-winning squad, winning back-to-back FA Cups in 2014 and 2015, that was admired by football fans everywhere.","title_az":"Arsene Wenger","rank":1344043.0,"category":"Biographies"},{"isbn":"1590389174","asin":null,"title_gr":"Parenting the Strong-Willed Child: Fortifying Our Youth and Healing Our Prodigals","author_name":"Kevin Hinckley","top_genre":"parenting","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.31,"ratings_count":108.0,"text_reviews_count":42.0,"description":null,"title_az":"Parenting the Strong-Willed Child: Fortifying Our Youth and Healing Our Prodigals","rank":1119615.0,"category":null},{"isbn":"0201626799","asin":null,"title_gr":"The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age","author_name":"John Horgan","top_genre":"science","publisher":"Basic Books","publication_year":1996.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":320.0,"average_rating":3.54,"ratings_count":315.0,"text_reviews_count":35.0,"description":"As staff writer for Scientific American,John Horgan has a window on contemporary science unsurpassed in all the world. Who else routinely interviews the likes of Lynn Margulis, Roger Penrose, Francis Crick, Richard Dawkins, Freeman Dyson, Murray Gell-Mann, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, Thomas Kuhn, Chris Langton, Karl Popper, Stephen Weinberg, and E.O. Wilson, with the freedom to probe their innermost thoughts?In The End Of Science,Horgan displays his genius for getting these larger-than-life figures to be simply human, and scientists, he writes, \"are rarely so human...so at ther mercy of their fears and desires, as when they are confronting the limits of knowledge.\"This is the secret fear that Horgan pursues throughout this remarkable book: Have the big questions all been answered? Has all the knowledge worth pursuing become known? Will there be a final \"theory of everything\" that signals the end?Is the age of great discoverers behind us? Is science today reduced to mere puzzle solving and adding detains to existing theories?Horgan extracts surprisingly candid answers to there and other delicate questions as he discusses God, Star Trek, superstrings, quarks, plectics, consciousness, Neural Darwinism, Marx's view of progress, Kuhn's view of revolutions, cellular automata, robots, and the Omega Point, with Fred Hoyle, Noam Chomsky, John Wheeler, Clifford Geertz, and dozens of other eminent scholars. The resulting narrative will both infuriate and delight as it mindles Horgan's smart, contrarian argument for \"endism\" with a witty, thoughtful, even profound overview of the entire scientific enterprise.Scientists have always set themselves apart from other scholars in the belief that they do not construct the truth, they discover it. Their work is not interpretation but simple revelation of what exists in the empirical universe. But science itself keeps imposing limits on its own power. Special relativity prohibits the transmission of matter or information as speeds faster than that of light; quantum mechanics dictates uncertainty; and chaos theory confirms the impossibility of complete prediction. Meanwhile, the very idea of scientific rationality is under fire from Neo-Luddites, animal-rights acitivists, religious fundamentalists, and New Agers alike.As Horgan makes clear, perhaps the greatest threat to science may come from losing its special place in the hierarchy of disciplines, being reduced to something more akin to literaty criticism as more and more theoreticians engage in the theory twiddling he calls \"ironic science.\" Still, while Horgan offers his critique, grounded in the thinking of the world's leading researchers, he offers homage too. If science is ending, he maintains, it is only because it has done its work so well.","title_az":"The End Of Science: Facing The Limits Of Knowledge In The Twilight Of The Scientific Age (Helix Books)","rank":1134626.0,"category":"Science&Math"},{"isbn":"014029984X","asin":null,"title_gr":"Generica","author_name":"Will Ferguson","top_genre":"fiction","publisher":"Penguin Canada","publication_year":2001.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":320.0,"average_rating":3.79,"ratings_count":90.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"An emotional balancing act of Herculean proportions, Will Ferguson's debut novel is somehow both caustically cynical and touchingly humane. Its message: there is no happiness without sadness. The pursuitof happiness is all--actually attaining it, if that were even possible, would be death. When Edwin de Valu, an editor at Panderic Press, finds What I Learned on the Mountain, a self-help book by an unknown author, Tupak Soiree, on his slush pile and publishes it, suddenly millions of people believe that pursuit is over. \"Apocalypse Nice\" has arrived, and Edwin's cynical side goes into high gear trying to save the world from itself. On this hysterical (in every sense of the word) quest, Edwin receives little help from his credulous wife, his plump co-worker (and sometime lover) May, or his ponytailed baby-boomer boss, Mr. Mead. This wacky, lightweight novel mixes elements from Dilbert, Woody Allen, grainy art films, and P.J. O'Rourke. While Ferguson lines up a number of easy targets and can be way too obvious (\"The Name of the Tulip\" echoes a certain highbrow mystery), he can also write with flair, as in describing Edwin's city: \"Here, in a miasma of fumes, trains rattle-bang on an endless Mobius strip of work, sweat, salt and grubby lucre.

ANTHONY LUKAS WORK-IN-PROGRESS AWARD\nAtop a craggy mesa in the northern reaches of the Navajo reservation lies what was once a world-class uranium mine called Monument No. 2. Discovered in the 1940s--during the government's desperate press to build nuclear weapons--the mesa's tremendous lode would forever change the lives of the hundreds of Native Americans who labored there and of their families, including many who dwelled in the valley below for generations afterward. Yellow Dirt offers readers a window into a dark chapter of modern history that still reverberates today. From the 1940s into the early twenty-first century, the United States knowingly used and discarded an entire tribe for the sake of atomic bombs. Secretly, during the days of the Manhattan Project and then in a frenzy during the Cold War, the government bought up all the uranium that could be mined from the hundreds of rich deposits entombed under the sagebrush plains and sandstone cliffs. Despite warnings from physicians and scientists that long-term exposure could be harmful, even fatal, thousands of miners would work there unprotected. A second set of warnings emerged about the environmental impact. Yet even now, long after the uranium boom ended, and long after national security could be cited as a consideration, many residents are still surrounded by contaminated air, water, and soil. The radioactive \"yellow dirt\" has ended up in their drinking supplies, in their walls and floors, in their playgrounds, in their bread ovens, in their churches, and even in their garbage dumps. And they are still dying. \nTransporting readers into a little-known country-within-a-country, award-winning journalist Judy Pasternak gives rare voice to Navajo perceptions of the world, their own complicated involvement with uranium mining, and their political coming-of-age. Along the way, their fates intertwine with decisions made in Washington, D.C., in the Navajo capital of Window Rock, and in the Western border towns where swashbuckling mining men trained their sights on the fortunes they could wrest from tribal land, successfully pressuring the government into letting them do it their way. \nYellow Dirt powerfully chronicles both a scandal of neglect and the Navajos' long fight for justice. Few had heard of this shameful legacy until Pasternak revealed it in a prize-winning Los Angeles Times series that galvanized a powerful congressman and a famous prosecutor to press for redress and repair of the grievous damage. In this expanded account, she provides gripping new details, weaving the personal and the political into a tale of betrayal, of willful negligence, and, ultimately, of reckoning.","title_az":"Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed","rank":1405059.0,"category":"Americas"},{"isbn":"0373608519","asin":null,"title_gr":"Too Close to Resist","author_name":"Nicole Helm","top_genre":"romance","publisher":"Harlequin","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":384.0,"average_rating":3.24,"ratings_count":42.0,"text_reviews_count":9.0,"description":"Forced proximity, natural attraction\nMoving in with her brother isn't what free-spirited Grace McKnight imagined doing at age thirty.

More than ever, there is a need for a non-partisan, common sense view about how to deal with these challenges. Mark Werts, Founder and CEO of American Rag Cie, offers that perspective, based on his unique vantage point as a global businessman and entrepreneur. In his new book, AMERICA'S SIMPLE SOLUTIONS: A Visionary's Blueprint for a Better Tomorrow, Werts tackles such issues as education, healthcare, immigration, taxes, education, and gun control, and offers simple solutions free of partisan bias, based on how these challenges are handled around the world.\nHaving lived, worked, and traveled across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, Werts has observed how others have approached the same dilemmas that we face in the United States. \"I have come to understand what is practical and works...I have also seen what is impractical and doesn't work. In our global world, why would America pursue an idea that has been proven again and again not to work in other places?\" he writes. Werts also reflects on the views of our country's Founding Fathers, suggesting that we have forgotten much of their considerable wisdom.\nThroughout, Werts emphasizes the importance of expanded freedom, especially for entrepreneurs and business. \"Individual freedom produces wealth and economic growth. This typically happens in a free market economy with the least amount of bureaucratic regulation,\" he attests, further arguing that people must be encouraged to take risks, and be allowed to keep the fruits of their labor and pass them on to their children. The author also stresses the critical roles played by education and political participation. \"A good, solid education for all of our citizens is the ultimate answer to our many challenges . . . and to get the best teachers, we must offer the best salaries,\" he writes. And he laments low voter turnout, urging all eligible Americans not only to vote, but to get involved in local boards and commissions.\nWith freedom, education, and voting as an underlying theme, Werts' \"simple solutions\" include:\nTaxation: \"When it comes to taxes, I think we can all agree that America's system is deeply flawed and impossible to understand,\" argues Werts. He explains that trillions of American business dollars stay overseas to avoid overly burdensome taxes, and that income tax is inequitably distributed. Pointing to Hong Kong's success with a flat tax - which has even resulted in budget surpluses - he advocates a sixteen percent flat tax, coupled with a consumption tax that would be higher on those who consume more.\nHealthcare: Pointing to the unusually high per capita spending on health care in the United States - which is not correlated with a longer lifespan - Werts suggests that much needs to be changed. He urges that the U.S. adopt the Canadian health care system, which gives everyone access to universal health care, and which costs only eleven percent of Canada's GDP, versus America's seventeen percent.\nEnvironment: \"Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge; it's common sense,\" says Werts. His simple solutions include a high-speed public train system, and making it financially profitable for the private sector to solve our environmental problems.\nGender and Equality: Werts writes that all women in the United States are still impacted by a gender wage gap. At the same time, he contends that men are discriminated against when it comes to such issues as family leave and child custody. He argues for paying women and men equally for the same jobs, and treating everyone the same when it comes to benefits, parenting, and family issues.\nGun Control: While advocating legal gun ownership, the author also supports required safety training, and a mandatory firearms test for gun owners - just as we have driving tests for drivers. \"Gun ownership doesn't have to be all or nothing,\" he contends.\nIn AMERICA'S SIMPLE SOLUTIONS, Werts offers a country-by-country look at other nations - suggesting where the U.S. can learn from their examples. \"My goal is not to criticize, but to show how we Americans are doing relative to other countries that are facing many of the same dilemmas, and to tell Americans what has worked elsewhere, and what could work here in the United States,\" he says.\nUltimately, Werts believes that we are at a monumental juncture, and that the future of individual freedom is at stake. \"We are faced with decisions that could re-ignite the unbelievable success our experiment in democracy has been,\" he states. AMERICA'S SIMPLE SOLUTIONS will empower people to get involved, and make the choices that will fuel both growth and freedom.","title_az":"America's Simple Solutions: A Visionary's Blueprint for a Better Tomorrow","rank":1753323.0,"category":"Politics&Government"},{"isbn":"1478129824","asin":null,"title_gr":"Campaign Zen 500bc - 2012: Colonial March Thru Election History Told in Tavern Doggerel","author_name":"Peter Prasad","top_genre":"politics","publisher":"Createspace","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":156.0,"average_rating":4.4,"ratings_count":5.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":"Colonial march thru election history.

Rhiannon Murphy visited the future, witnessed hell on earth and made choices to change things for the greater good. Unfortunately there are consequences for her actions, the penalties for her interference possibly more than she can bear. Determined to sever her debt with a fallen angel, she pushes everything aside, focusing on locating Marigold Vesta's resting place. Until death comes knocking at her door. When Disco's maker arrives in New York, he resents Rhiannon on a level she can't begin to comprehend. Yet Marius isn't her most dangerous adversary, not by a long shot. Marius's sire -- a half-demon -- is determined to see the necromancer who stunned the vampire world on her knees. If she won't bend, he'll do everything in his power to make her break. No price is too high, meaning no one is safe -- including Disco and Paine. Dealt a blow from which she can never recover, Rhiannon turns to the only person who can help her: the fallen angel who is relying on Rhiannon to save her soul. Bartering with a creature from Heaven is probably just as dangerous as starting a war with a demon from Hell, but with nothing to lose it's no longer about life or death.

The Rock and Roll Film Encyclopedia includes: * 230 film entries from 1956 through 2005, including cast list, creative personnel, M.P.A.A. rating, running time, and DVD availability. * Entries on the familiar conventions of this unique cinematic form, such as the Vietnam War, the ubiquitous press conference (in which band members wax philosophical), the rampant destruction of property (hotel rooms, specifically) and even the Yoko factor (meddling girlfriends). Biographical entries on players who made significant impact on the silver screen, from Elvis Presley and The Beatles to Alice Cooper and Prince.

Her hallucinations hunt her, and her skin heats to a burn every time her anger flares. Or is that all in her head?\nLayla doesn't know what to believe any more because if none of that's true, Max MacLarnon must be an illusion, and her heart must still be broken. No matter how much she wants to believe Max is real, doing so would mean everything else is, too. How, then, is that possible?\nThe answers lie in an age-old legend the supernatural aren't prepared to reveal, and with a curse that could tear Layla and Max apart forever--if it doesn't kill them both first.\nLearning the truth will mean fighting an arsenal of demons, and being with Max will put Layla on a path toward her own destruction. Just how far will Layla go to protect the one she loves?

Since his retirement, he has earned a reputation as an equally uncompromising commentator, never afraid to tell it as he sees it and lash out at the money men and professionals that have made rugby into such a different beast. Yet, for all his bullishness on and off the pitch, there also appears a more unconventional, complicated side to the man. A solicitor by trade, Moore's love of fine wine, career experience as a manicurist, and preference for reading Shakespeare in the dressing room before games, mark him out as anything but the stereotypical rugby player, and in Beware of the Dog, Moore lays open with astounding frankness the shocking events, both personal and professional, that have gone towards shaping him over the years.

Twelve years after the devastating loss of their dearest friend Emily, they find themselves still affected by the trauma.\nAbigail, married and newly pregnant, helps others through her work for the Department of Children and Families. When a new client with epilepsy unexpectedly forces her to re-examine the past, Abigail realizes she's the one who needs saving. Stephen has struggled emotionally, physically and spiritually after losing the love of his life, and the long-term effects of his grief have kept him from truly living and finding love again.\nAs the two search for redemption and the power to heal, their paths cross once again. Emily's presence so long ago still has meaning in their own lives, teaching them the meaning of true friendship and what's really important. Drawing on her own experience with a close friend with epilepsy who died, author Laurie Bellesheim raises awareness about the disease in this compelling tale told partially through flashbacks.\nLaurie Bellesheim, a published poet, belongs to several writers' organizations including Writer's Digest, Authors Den and Writing.com. Bellesheim was inspired to write Surviving Emily because she lost a close friend to Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy when she was 18. Before writing Surviving Emily, her first novel, Bellesheim was a social worker for six years, including working with the Department of Children and Families. She graduated from Southern Connecticut State University with a bachelor's degree in social work.

Churches collapsed upon thousands of worshippers celebrating the holy day. \"Earthquakes in Human History\" tells the story of that calamity and other epic earthquakes. The authors, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer and Donald Theodore Sanders, recapture the power of their previous book, \"Volcanoes in Human History.\" They vividly explain the geological processes responsible for earthquakes, and they describe how these events have had long-lasting aftereffects on human societies and cultures. Their accounts are enlivened with quotations from contemporary literature and from later reports.\nIn the chaos following the Lisbon quake, government and church leaders vied for control. The Marques de Pombal rose to power and became a virtual dictator. As a result, the Roman Catholic Jesuit Order lost much of its influence in Portugal. Voltaire wrote his satirical work \"Candide\" to refute the philosophy of \"optimism,\" the belief that God had created a perfect world. And the 1755 earthquake sparked the search for a scientific understanding of natural disasters.\nRanging from an examination of temblors mentioned in the Bible, to a richly detailed account of the 1906 catastrophe in San Francisco, to Japan's Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, to the Peruvian earthquake in 1970 (the Western Hemisphere's greatest natural disaster), this book is an unequaled testament to a natural phenomenon that can be not only terrifying but also threatening to humankind's fragile existence, always at risk because of destructive powers beyond our control.\"","title_az":"Earthquakes in Human History: The Far-Reaching Effects of Seismic Disruptions","rank":704562.0,"category":"EarthSciences"},{"isbn":"1534631496","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Lizard Queen Volume One","author_name":"H.L.

A secret society that formed to prevent its occurrence believed it was their doing, while the secret society created to ensure that the prophecy came to pass wasn't certain it had been stopped at all. Eventually, the prophecy of Lacaruna, a female from another realm and the only being who can read the Lizard Queen's language, fell into legend. What no one realizes, however, is that Amy Darlidale is just a tad late. THIS SHRINKING WORLD Taking a break from a stressful workweek, Amy, a recently divorced CEO, goes out for a morning jog and crosses paths with an orange lizard. Suddenly, she finds herself under a starless sky confronted by oddly marked and strangely colored people who claim she's there to rescue the world from evil's grasp and expand it once again. But not everyone wants that to happen so there's a price on her head. This is far from the relaxing weekend Amy had intended. FROM THE ASHES Along with the young companions who found her, Licha and Jandro, Amy has accompanied the swaggering Colonel Dack Sangcertigre-a member of the Trotejo, the secret society sworn to protect her-to his home nation in search of a plan to fulfill the Promise of a New Morphosis. As the body count rises and she is confronted with raving rulers, military machinations, and crafty clergy, she quickly realizes there must be much more at stake than merely finding the prophecy. A SPECTACULAR LIE The sense of order in this mysterious world continues to collapse. Fires rage, clans are being slaughtered and townsfolk massacred, and leaders have proclaimed a great evil has returned. As Amy searches for clues within the first mythic journals of this world's origins, she's begun seeing visions and receiving messages from forces unknown.

But will he be able to survive the gauntlet of destruction known as the Great Tribulation? Seven seals, seven trumpets and seven vials of God's wrath are about to be poured out upon the earth, and woe to the inhabitants thereof! Global currencies have collapsed, famine and plague have claimed the lives of millions, and the world has crumbled into chaos. The only reason Everett and his girlfriend, Courtney, have survived the mayhem is because they were warned by John Jones, Everett's recently deceased boss, that all of these tragedies would occur. And what's more, through his inside knowledge at the agency, mixed with his interpretation of prophecy, Jones predicted that a world leader would ride in on a white horse to fix the ills of the planet. But who is this leader and what is his motivation for mandating the new identification implant and the global cashless currency? Everett is surprised when he finds out that Elijah, the Messianic Jewish hermit who lives on the mountain above their retreat, did not disappear along with the rest of the Christians. When he tells Everett of a special mission that God has given him, the old prophet gives Everett more questions than answers.

Kloppenberg presents the history of democracy from the perspective of those who struggled to envision and achieve it. The story of democracy remains one without an ending, a dynamic of progress and regress that continues to our own day. In the classical age \"democracy\" was seen as the failure rather than the ideal of good governance. Democracies were deemed chaotic and bloody, indicative of rule by the rabble rather than by enlightened minds. Beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries, however, first in Europe and then in England's North American colonies, the reputation of democracy began to rise, resulting in changes that were sometimes revolutionary and dramatic, sometimes gradual and incremental.\nKloppenberg offers a fresh look at how concepts and institutions of representative government developed and how understandings of self-rule changed over time on both sides of the Atlantic. Notions about what constituted true democracy preoccupied many of the most influential thinkers of the Western world, from Montaigne and Roger Williams to Milton and John Locke; from Rousseau and Jefferson to Wollstonecraft and Madison; and from de Tocqueville and J. S. Mill to Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Over three centuries, explosive ideas and practices of democracy sparked revolutions--English, American, and French--that again and again culminated in civil wars, disastrous failures of democracy that impeded further progress.\nComprehensive, provocative, and authoritative, Toward Democracy traces self-government through three pivotal centuries. The product of twenty years of research and reflection, this momentous work reveals how nations have repeatedly fallen short in their attempts to construct democratic societies based on the principles of autonomy, equality, deliberation, and reciprocity that they have claimed to prize. Underlying this exploration lies Kloppenberg's compelling conviction that democracy was and remains an ethical ideal rather than merely a set of institutions, a goal toward which we continue to struggle.","title_az":"Toward Democracy: The Struggle for Self-Rule in European and American Thought","rank":719076.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"1432771388","asin":null,"title_gr":"Romance with a Touch of Love","author_name":"Kevin Hollingsworth","top_genre":"short-story-novella-2017","publisher":"Outskirts Press","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":30.0,"average_rating":4.18,"ratings_count":17.0,"text_reviews_count":12.0,"description":"My name is Kevin Hollingsworth and I would like to touch your heart.

Before you fly into that building...\nWhat is truth? Is it knowable?\nCan we be absolutely certain about anything?\nA momentous work of philosophy doesn't have to be massive and unreadable. No example of philosophy that you'll encounter will deal with Certainty and Truth more concisely and compellingly than this book, yet it does so while maintaining an engaging style that keeps the cerebral content very readable and accessible. Like previous philosophies that address Certainty and Truth, the work HAD to address the issue of God, yet unlike it's predecessors, manages to do so without any hidden assumptions. As a result, it holds confirmations of orthodox Christianity that are unprecedented.\nThe book adopts a partially autobiographical style as it details how the hyper-rational author went from the purest form of agnosticism to fundamentalist Christianity over a span of years. Within are essays that address common misconceptions that skeptics and Christians share.

Although James had no formal training as a dressmaker, he created strikingly original and complex designs, including intricate ball gowns worn by members of high society in New York and Europe. This lavishly illustrated book offers a comprehensive study of James' life and work, highlighting his virtuosity and inventiveness as well as his influence on subsequent fashion designers.\nFeaturing exciting new photography of the spectacular evening dresses James produced between 1947 and 1955, this publication includes enlightening details of these intricate creations alongside vintage photographs and rarely seen archival items, such as patterns, muslins, dress forms, and sketches. A detailed and illustrated chronology of James' life describes his magnetic personality, his unorthodox design processes, his colorful supporters--such as Salvador Dali, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Cristobal Balenciaga--and profiles of a number of his famous clients, such as Gypsy Rose Lee.

These characters exist on the fringes of normal society. What is normal for them--using a bungee cord to tie an invalid father to a window in order to go drinking, engaging in an extreme competition to settle a bet for a classic Camaro, burning up a bar after being told that to have another drink would certify death, et cetera--would be appalling to most. It is in these appalling moments that the stories find the most traction. They scrape the bottom of the barrel of humanity and transform it, and readers watch as the characters struggle with those transformations and failed attempts. In the end, while the individual characters may not find some ultimate resolution for their vices, readers are left with a sense of completion as they watch the bar they've seen in multiple stories go up in flames. Later in the collection, the characters experience similar downfalls, but elsewhere, showing how similar we all really are when our backs are against the wall and alcohol seems like the only option.\nThe collection speaks to the Grit aesthetic of writers like Harry Crews and Barry Hannah. Readers of contemporary Southern fiction would find these stories appealing for their characters and the depravity that some sink into just to get their fix. Other readers would take interest in the hope that certain characters attempt to find when all else but the bottle seems lost.","title_az":"God in Neon","rank":7931142.0,"category":"ShortStories&Anthologies"},{"isbn":"0618773398","asin":null,"title_gr":"User ID: A Novel of Identity Theft","author_name":"Jenefer Shute","top_genre":"fiction","publisher":"Mariner Books","publication_year":2006.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":258.0,"average_rating":3.03,"ratings_count":83.0,"text_reviews_count":17.0,"description":"What if someone stole your identity . . . but you didn't want it anyway?\nThe New York professor Vera de Sica is tired of her life -- it hasn't turned out the way she hoped but, then again, it is her life.

The young couple set up a diving service catering to tourists eager to bask in the warm sunshine and explore the silent, gleaming marine paradise that makes this otherwise barren volcanic island such a remarkable retreat. Sven's approach was simple: take the mechanics of diving seriously, instruct his clients clearly, and stay out of their personal business as best he can.\nAnd life on the island goes smoothly until two German tourists--Jola von der Pahlen, a daytime soap star on the verge of cinematic success, and Theo Hast, a stalled novelist--engage Sven for a high-priced, intensive two-week diving experience. Staying in a guest house on Sven and Antje's property, the two visitors and their hosts quickly become embroiled in a tangle of jealousy and suspicion.\nSven is struck by Jola's beauty, her evident wealth, and her apparently volatile relationship with the much older Theo. Theo quickly leaps to the conclusion that Sven and Jola are having an affair, but, oddly, he seems to facilitate it rather than trying to intervene. Antje, looking on, grows increasingly wary of these particular clients.\nAs the point of view shifts from one character to the next, the reader is constantly kept guessing about who knows what, and, more important, who is telling the truth. A brutal game of delusion, temptation, and manipulation plays out, pointing toward a violent end.

Following the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, the returning vets and their children took the unprecedented economic growth and federal activism to new heights. This generation was led by presidents who believed in the commonwealth ideal: the belief that federal legislation, by encouraging individual opportunity, would result in the betterment of the entire nation. In the years after the war, these presidents created an outpouring of federal legislation that changed how and where people lived, their access to higher education, and their stewardship of the environment. They also spearheaded historic efforts to level the playing field for minorities, women and immigrants. But this dynamic did not last, and Goldfield shows how the shrinking of the federal government shut subsequent generations off from those gifts.\nDavid Goldfield brings this unprecedented surge in American legislative and cultural history to life as he explores the presidencies of Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Lyndon Baines Johnson. He brilliantly shows how the nation's leaders persevered to create the conditions for the most gifted generation in U.S. history.","title_az":"The Gifted Generation: When Government Was Good","rank":240694.0,"category":"Politics&amp;Government"},{"isbn":"0714530603","asin":null,"title_gr":"De Sade's Valet","author_name":"Nikolaj Frobenius","top_genre":"historical-fiction","publisher":"Marion Boyars Publishers Ltd","publication_year":2001.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":242.0,"average_rating":3.35,"ratings_count":10.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"In 18th-century Honfleur, a child is born with a terrifying destiny before him.

Their own backgrounds, ambitions and passions also contribute to what they have to say about ministry. The contours of New Testament pastoral leadership, inspired by the Holy Spirit, exhibit a genuine diversity that finds its unity in Christ and his gospel. Focusing on pastoral leadership within local churches or groups of churches, Derek Tidball provides a comprehensive survey of these models and patterns with applications for today's ministry. Tidball's overview offers \"models of permission\" that enable a freer approach to ministry and the way it is conducted, challenges the stunted understanding of ministry that can often characterize our churches today, and gives encouragement to those who do not fit a \"ministry by numbers\" approach. Well-grounded in relevant scholarship, Tidball's fresh engagement with the biblical texts, stimulating analysis and wise application will be of value to all who are established in pastoral leadership, or training for it, and looking to explore a variety of biblically valid approaches to ministry.","title_az":"Ministry by the Book: New Testament Patterns for Pastoral Leadership","rank":401401.0,"category":"Humanities"},{"isbn":"0749929464","asin":null,"title_gr":"Sun King","author_name":"Kevin Crouch","top_genre":"deejay","publisher":"Little, Brown UK","publication_year":2009.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":256.0,"average_rating":3.21,"ratings_count":18.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"Music producer Sam Phillips and his landmark studio, Sun Records, hold a unique place in the history of rock 'n' roll - by many accounts, before Phillips recorded 'Rocket 88' by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats in 1951, rock 'n' roll as we know it didn't even exist. Phillips is simultaneously hailed as the man who discovered Elvis Presley and derided as the man who sold the same artist to RCA for a paltry $35,000. The list of musical legends that passed through the doors of Sun Records is simply astounding, including BB King, Ike Turner, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis and more.\nSUN KING strips away the glossy veneer of legend around the Phillips story - which, like his signature sound, was much the result of his own careful crafting - to reveal a man who, from a very young age, heard a musical sound that no one else heard.

Combined, these two simple acts encourage us to improve the way we work and the way we make choices to balance our personal, professional, and social lives.

He advances what he believes is a commonsensical notion: a state's domestic identity has an enormous effect on its international policies. Hopf argues that foreign policy elites are inextricably bound to their own societies; in order to understand other states, they must first understand themselves. To comprehend Russian and Soviet foreign policy, \"it is just as important to read what is being consumed on the Moscow subway as it is to conduct research in the Foreign Ministry archives,\" the author says.Hopf recreates the major currents in Russian\/Soviet identity, reconstructing the \"identity topographies\" of two profoundly important years, 1955 and 1999. To provide insights about how Russians made sense of themselves in the post-Stalinist and late Yeltsin periods, he not only uses daily newspapers and official discourse, but also delves into works intended for mass consumption--popular novels, film reviews, ethnographic journals, high school textbooks, and memoirs. He explains how the different identities expressed in these varied materials shaped the worldviews of Soviet and Russian decisionmakers. Hopf finds that continuous renegotiations and clashes among competing domestic visions of national identity had a profound effect on Soviet and Russian foreign policy. Broadly speaking, Hopf shows that all international politics begins at home.","title_az":"Social Construction of Foreign Policy: Identities and Foreign Policies, Moscow, 1955 and 1999","rank":1525428.0,"category":"Humanities"},{"isbn":"0072257849","asin":null,"title_gr":"Crcp Crystal Reports Certified Professional All-In-One [With CDROM]","author_name":"Annette Harper","top_genre":"bi","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.14,"ratings_count":7.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":null,"title_az":"CRCP Crystal Reports Certified Professional All-in-One","rank":2888522.0,"category":"Networking&CloudComputing"},{"isbn":"1616640715","asin":null,"title_gr":"Uptown","author_name":"Virginia DeBerry","top_genre":"fiction","publisher":"Touchstone Books","publication_year":2010.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.68,"ratings_count":19.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":null,"title_az":"Uptown","rank":3416400.0,"category":"WomensFiction"},{"isbn":"1937498549","asin":null,"title_gr":"Fault Lines: The Layman's Guide to Understanding America's Role in the  Ever-Changing Middle East","author_name":"Don Liebich","top_genre":"politics","publisher":"Elevate","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":176.0,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":18.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"Fault Lines is the story of one man's journey to understanding America's role in the Middle East.

Through countless millennia, through the 'mayfly flickerings' of innumerable transient civilizations, its members have intervened at critical junctions, reseeding the galaxy with viable potential survivors. In the process, they have reconfigured the basic structure of the universe, all in the name of human continuity.\nPierce is a newly recruited member of the Stasis, serving out a complex twenty-year apprenticeship while struggling to find his way through the paradoxical maze of history (and unhistory) that surrounds him. As his once simple existence expands and replicates over vast stretches of time, Pierce uncovers a new and unexpected destiny, one that will embroil him in the larger purposes of the Stasis and in the ultimate, unresolved fate of humanity itself.\nSkillfully merging the threads of an individual life with the grandest, most overarching concerns, Palimpsest offers both visionary brilliance and narrative excitement in equal measure. Powerfully imagined, beautifully constructed, and written throughout with great economy of means, it is the kind of mind-expanding mini-epic that only science fiction--and only a master practitioner like Charles Stross--could produce.","title_az":"Palimpsest","rank":1821368.0,"category":"UnitedStates"},{"isbn":"1568984669","asin":null,"title_gr":"Waiting for the End of the World","author_name":"Richard Koss","top_genre":"photography","publisher":"Princeton Architectural Press","publication_year":2004.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":128.0,"average_rating":3.81,"ratings_count":42.0,"text_reviews_count":9.0,"description":"Where will you go when the trouble starts? For countless people around the world, the answer is that bomb shelter down in the basement. In fact, people from around the work have been building shelters to protect themselves from catastrophe -- natural disaster, war, nuclear events -- for centuries. Waiting for the End of the Worldis photographer Richard Ross's journey into this quirky, somewhat paranoid, and occasionally beautiful underground world. Ross has documented not only the bomb shelters of the United States, but also examples from Vietnam, Russia, England, Turkey, and even Switzerland, where citizens are required by law to have a bomb shelter.\nRoss's subjects include the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia, where a shelter was built to house the entire U.S. Congress, shelters in Beijing, where the Chinese built a complete city underground, and Hittite shelters in Eastern Turkey built some 4,000 years ago. His ethereal images show spaces that at once provide only the barest necessities for survival but maintain a level of idiosyncratic personality that testify to the endurance -- and wackiness -- of the human spirit.\nWaiting for the End of the Worldfeatures an interview by author and social commentator Sarah Vowell.","title_az":"Waiting for the End of the World","rank":1028275.0,"category":"Engineering"},{"isbn":"1574219707","asin":null,"title_gr":"Creative Coloring Flowers: Art Activity Pages to Relax and Enjoy!","author_name":"Valentina Harper","top_genre":"coloring-books","publisher":"Design Originals","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":72.0,"average_rating":4.33,"ratings_count":12.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"Inject a little whimsy into your daily grind!

He arrived unannounced, where and when she needed him most . . . Forty-year-old Sandy Richards is a successful music teacher, wife, and mother living a comfortable middle class life in a small Midwestern town. But behind her warm smile and easy laugh is a heavy burden she cannot release.During her childhood, Sandy (or Shadow as just about everyone knew her) was inseparable from her larger-than-life father, a World War II hero she adored. Sandy followed him everywhere, hung on his every word, and loved him with all her heart as only a young child can. Sometimes loving him was more difficult than others, especially when he was there and then he was gone right in front of her eyes without ever leaving the house.For reasons she would not fully understand until many years later, something went horribly wrong and their relationship fractured, seemingly forever, when her father died of lung cancer on one long hot summer evening. His passing left Shadow alone to sort through his warehouse of junk, an old storage facility jammed with emotions so overwhelming they balanced her on the edge of suicide. Then, when and where she needed him most, a stranger entered her life. And everything changed once more.The Final Service offers a riveting story about human nature, emotional abandonment, and how unfulfilled dreams left a middle-aged woman on the brink of personal destruction until one event forever altered the core of her belief system and her life. It is a story of faith, family, and forgiveness, and the realization that forces larger and more powerful than ourselves are at work in our lives in ways we are unable to fully understand.REVIEWS Advance Praise for The Final Service Gary W. Moore has a knack for telling our stories. Whether it s a dream interrupted in Playing with the Enemy or a personal journey of discovery in Hey Buddy, Moore tells us about ourselves while writing about others. Never is that more true than in The Final Service, where a father s misunderstood love nearly tears his daughter apart. Love doesn t always come in the shape we expect. If we re lucky, we realize that before it s too late. Steve Bertrand WGN Radio, host of Steve Bertrand on Books A poignant story of redemption, the power of forgiveness, and the wisdom that comes later in life when we see our parents as they really are. Regine Schlesinger, WBBM Radio, Chicago The Final Service is a song of pain and grief and life and death. Author Gary W. Moore highlights the impact of war not only on the combatants themselves but on their families. Decades of sorrow, loss, and guilt erode human connections, but loyalty, understanding, and memory are the magical ties that reach beyond the grave. The parable of Sandy and her father Tom celebrates the complexities of love. Bravo to Gary for touching my crusty old heart. Joyce Faulkner, the award-winning author of In the Shadow of Suribachi and Windshift, and former President of Military Writers of America A compelling and endearing story about what matters most in a time when it matters most of all.

But in this inspirational and practical memoir, Paula Penn-Nabrit shares her intimate experiences of home-schooling her three sons, Charles, Damon, and Evan. Paula and her husband, C. Madison, decided to home-school their children after racial incidents at public and private schools led them to the conclusion that the traditional educational system would be damaging to their sons' self-esteem. This decision was especially poignant for the Nabrit family because C. Madison's uncle was the famed civil rights attorney James Nabrit, who, with Thurgood Marshall, had argued Brown v. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court; to other members of their family, it seemed as if Paula and C. Madison were turning their backs on a rich educational legacy.\nBut ultimately, Paula and C. Madison felt that they knew what was best for their sons. So in 1991--when Evan was nine and twins Charles and Damon were eleven--the children were withdrawn from the exclusive country day school they'd been attending.\nIn Morning by Morning, Paula Penn-Nabrit discusses her family's emotional transition to home schooling and shares the nuts and bolts of the boys' educational experience. She explains how she and her husband developed a curriculum, provided adequate exposure to the arts as well as quiet time for reflection and meditation, initiated quality opportunities for volunteerism, and sought out athletic activities for their sons. At the end of each chapter, she offers advice on how readers can incorporate some of the steps her family took--even if they aren't able to home-school; plus, there's a website resource guide at the end of the book.\nCharles and Damon were eventually admitted to Princeton, and Evan attended Amherst College.

In 1935, aged 22, he developed the mathematical theory upon which all subsequent stored-program digital computers are modeled.\nAt the outbreak of hostilities with Germany in September 1939, he joined the Government Codebreaking team at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire and played a crucial role in deciphering Engima, the code used by the German armed forces to protect their radio communications. Turing's work on the version of Enigma used by the German navy was vital to the battle for supremacy in the North Atlantic. He also contributed to the attack on the cyphers known as \"Fish,\" which were used by the German High Command for the encryption of signals during the latter part of the war. His contribution helped to shorten the war in Europe by an estimated two years.\nAfter the war, his theoretical work led to the development of Britain's first computers at the National Physical Laboratory and the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University.\nTuring was also a founding father of modern cognitive science, theorizing that the cortex at birth is an \"unorganized machine\" which through \"training\" becomes organized \"into a universal machine or something like it.\" He went on to develop the use of computers to model biological growth, launching the discipline now referred to as Artificial Life.\nThe papers in this book are the key works for understanding Turing's phenomenal contribution across all these fields. The collection includes Turing's declassified wartime \"Treatise on the Enigma\"; letters from Turing to Churchill and to codebreakers; lectures, papers, and broadcasts which opened up the concept of AI and its implications; and the paper which formed the genesis of the investigation of Artifical Life.","title_az":"The Essential Turing: Seminal Writings in Computing, Logic, Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Life plus The Secrets of Enigma","rank":779555.0,"category":"ComputerScience"},{"isbn":"1877864757","asin":null,"title_gr":"Germany: Unraveling an Enigma","author_name":"Greg Nees","top_genre":"history","publisher":"Nicholas Brealey","publication_year":2000.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":228.0,"average_rating":3.66,"ratings_count":87.0,"text_reviews_count":12.0,"description":"So we think we know a lot about Germans? After all, more Germans have immigrated to the United States than any other ethnic group, and fifty million American citizens currently claim German heritage. The truth is, though, Germans are different from us-in more ways than we may know.\nGreg Nees, in this new InterAct, Germany: Unraveling an Enigma, does an outstanding job of explaining those cultural differences that we most need to know in order to have effective and fulfilling interactions with the Germans. Nees explores major German cultural themes: the need for order and obedience to rules and regulations, the insistence on clarity of thought, compartmentalization, the penchant for rational thinking and the love of abstract debate, the sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders, a strong sense of duty, and German communication patterns.\nAs a business consultant who has lived and worked many years with Germans, Greg Nees gives special attention to the German social market economy and to cultural differences in the workplace. Perhaps most valuable, in his last chapter he looks to the future as Germany seeks to create a new identity in the twenty-first century, dealing with such issues as multiculturalism, Americanization, changing lifestyles, the European Union, and globalization.","title_az":"Germany: Unraveling an Enigma","rank":998337.0,"category":"Humanities"},{"isbn":"0997745525","asin":null,"title_gr":"Mr. Either\/Or","author_name":"Aaron Poochigian","top_genre":"poetry","publisher":"Etruscan Press","publication_year":2017.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":184.0,"average_rating":4.53,"ratings_count":30.0,"text_reviews_count":20.0,"description":"Aaron Poochigian's Mr. Either\/Oris an ingenious debut, a verse novel melding American mythology, noir thriller, and classical epic into gritty rhythms, foreboding overtones, and groovy jams surrounding the reader in a surreal atmosphere.

In 1848, Wright and her older sister Lucretia Mott were among the five brave women who organized the historic Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention. Wright remained a prominent figure in the women's movement until her death in 1875 at age sixty-eight, when she was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. At age twenty-six, she attended the 1833 founding of the American Anti-Slavery Society and later presided over numerous antislavery meetings, including two in 1861 that were disrupted by angry antiabolitionist mobs. Active in the Underground Railroad, she sheltered fugitive slaves and was a close friend and supporter of Harriet Tubman.\nIn telling Wright's story, the authors make good use of her lively letters to her family, friends, and colleagues, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. These letters reveal Wright's engaging wit and offer an insider's view of nineteenth-century reform and family life. Her correspondence with slaveholding relatives in the South grew increasingly contentious with the approach of the Civil War. One nephew became a hero of the Confederacy with his exploits at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and her son in the Union artillery was seriously wounded at Gettysburg while repelling Pickett's Charge.\nWright's life never lacked for drama. She survived a shipwreck, spent time at a frontier fort, experienced the trauma of the deaths of a fiance, her first husband, and three of her seven children, and navigated intense conflicts within the women's rights and abolition movements. Throughout her tumultuous career, she drew on a reservoir of humor to promote her ideas and overcome the many challenges she faced. This accessible biography, written with the general reader in mind, does justice to her remarkable life.\"","title_az":"A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights","rank":2534824.0,"category":"Historical"},{"isbn":"0872332225","asin":null,"title_gr":"Rust Belt Boy: Stories of an American Childhood","author_name":"Paul Hertneky","top_genre":"midwest","publisher":"Bauhan Pub","publication_year":2016.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":224.0,"average_rating":4.17,"ratings_count":35.0,"text_reviews_count":10.0,"description":"These stories are specific to one legendary riverfront plateau and one boy s journey, but are emblematic of immigrant life and blue-collar aspirations during the heyday of American industry and its crash, foreshadowing one of the largest internal migrations in U.S. history.\nApproximately six million baby boomers, like the narrator, fled the Rust Belt.

Think of the inherent sweetness that can be coaxed from perfectly roasted Brussels sprouts, or the bright, peppery punch of a watercress and arugula salad.\nStraightforward cooking methods like roasting, sauteing, pickling, and wilting transform brassicas into satisfying dishes, such as Cauliflower Hummus, Spicy Kale Fried Rice, Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Parmesan Crust, and Broccoli and Pepper Jack Frittata. These recipes also maintain the vegetables' stellar nutritional properties. High in vitamins and minerals, fiber, phytochemicals, and glucosinolates, brassicas have been shown to act as antioxidants, anticarcinogenics, anti-inflammatories, and liver detoxifiers, and have many other health benefits.\nThe beauty of these \"superfoods\" is on full display in Brassicas; exquisite photographs of brassica varieties in their raw forms--roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and buds--can be found throughout, helping you identify Lacinato kale from curly kale or mustard greens from collard greens at the farmers' market or grocery store.\nFor those who observe certain dietary restrictions, author Laura B. Russell provides alternatives and tips to accommodate gluten-free, soy-free, vegetarian, and vegan diets. Equipped with complete selection, storage, washing, and prepping instructions, you can enjoy more of these nutritional powerhouses--from the commonplace kale to the more adventurous bok choy or mizuna--in your everyday meals.","title_az":"Brassicas: Cooking the World's Healthiest Vegetables: Kale, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts and More","rank":110427.0,"category":"HomeImprovement&amp;Design"},{"isbn":"1607746433","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Blender Girl: Super-Easy, Super-Healthy Meals, Snacks, Desserts, and Drinks--100 Gluten-Free, Vegan Recipes!","author_name":"Tess Masters","top_genre":"cookbooks","publisher":"Ten Speed Press","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":224.0,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":344.0,"text_reviews_count":46.0,"description":"The debut cookbook from the powerhouse blogger behind theblendergirl.com, featuring 100 gluten-free, vegan recipes for smoothies, meals, and moremade quickly and easily in a blender.\nWhat's your perfect blend?\nOn her wildly popular recipe blog, Tess Masters--aka, The Blender Girl--shares easy plant-based recipes that anyone can whip up fast in a blender.

In all situations, the victim is eventually lured into an endless period of advance fee payment. The \"black money\" scam is almost as popular as the advance fee fraud and is sometimes, practiced in continuation of advance fee scam. The victim is introduced to a large sum of money that needs to be cleaned by a special liquid solution. The victim parts with money upon the supposition that the black money would be cleaned and given to him. The con man gets away with the victim's money leaving him with a bunch of worthless papers.\nThe 419 Scam business is not restricted to defrauding foreigners. There are two groups of con men in Nigeria: The local and the International \"419ners.\" The local groups specialize in defrauding Nigerians while the more advanced International syndicates fish out victims from Europe, America, Asia and South Africa.

However, to those who served with Heller in the 340th Bomb Group the novel's characters were indeed recognizable - the hard-drinking, vengeful, and disillusioned Chief White Half Oat, young, sliced-in-half Kid Sampson, shrieking, frenzied Hungry Joe, Colonel Cathcart, General Dreedle, Yossarian and that capitalist supreme, Milo Minderbinder.\nIn this book, written and colorfully illustrated by the daughter of the 340th Bomb Group's commander, Colonel Willis Chapman, we finally encounter the real men and combat missions on which the novel was based. While Heller's fully developed characters stand solely, solidly and uniquely on their own merits, 'The True Story of Catch-22' proves that any resemblance to persons living or dead is, in fact, actual. This three-part book blends fact, fancy, and history with full-blown original illustrations and rare, previously unpublished photos of these daring USAAF flyers and their Corsican-based B-25 Mitchell medium bombers.\nAlong with descriptions of the 340th's real wartime events, the work includes twelve men of the Bomb Group relating twelve richly told tales of their own. Now all of the men upon whom Heller based his characters are gone. However, the last survivor, George L. Wells, was an extraordinary combat pilot who tied the record for the number of bombing missions flown in WWII with 102.\nGeorge, the model for Catch-22's Capt. Wren, is the common thread who weaves through this book, allowing the reader to truly feel the war and even thumb through George's well-worn mission book describing attacks on Axis ports, ships, bridges, and the notorious Brenner Pass.\nIn this book the reader will discover that truth is indeed as fascinating as fiction! Author Patricia Chapman Meder has been a professional artist in both fine and commercial art for the past 35 years, 13 of them in Europe. When Catch-22 was published it was quickly apparent that this book was based on the Bomb Group her father commanded in World War II. This true-life parallel book thus begged to be written. Pat Meder has also written a full-color companion work to \"The True Story of Catch-22,\" containing her delightful original artwork and caricatures of the individuals, \"The True Story of Catch-22 Illustrated.\"\nREVIEWS --- Heller's satiric caricatures are here shown to have stemmed from patriotic, courageous, highly decorated airmen who daily performed heroic wartime feats against overwhelming obstacles. The log of George Wells (Captain Wren in Catch-22), who flew a record 102 missions in his B-25, is included in an appendix.\nLibrary Journal..\".uses rare and unpublished photos to bring our actual heroes to life through use of first person narrative...Fans of Catch-22 will enjoy the book. It makes good use of diaries, logs, and photos to bring the people to life.\"\n\"For those unfamiliar with Catch-22 the book will make you curious enough to pickup Heller's book...\" Irish Defence Forces Veterans Association","title_az":"The True Story of Catch 22: The Real Men and Missions of Joseph Heller's 340th Bomb Group in World War II","rank":940290.0,"category":"Military"},{"isbn":"1612001025","asin":null,"title_gr":"Kimberly's Flight: The Story of Captain Kimberly Hampton, America's First Woman Combat Pilot Killed in Battle","author_name":"Anna  Simon","top_genre":"aviation","publisher":"Casemate","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":304.0,"average_rating":4.34,"ratings_count":23.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"U.S. Army Captain Kimberly N. Hampton was living her dream: flying armed helicopters in combat and commanding D Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry, the armed reconnaissance aviation squadron of the 82nd Airborne Division. An all-American girl from a small southern mill town, Kimberly was a top scholar, student body president, ROTC battalion commander, and highly ranked college tennis player.

Then, driven by determination and ambition, Kimberly rapidly rose through the ranks in the almost all-male bastion of military aviation to command a combat aviation troop.\nOn January 2, 2004, Captain Hampton was flying an OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter above Fallujah, Iraq, in support of a raid on an illicit weapons marketplace, searching for an illusive sniper on the rooftops of the city. A little past noon her helicopter was wracked by an explosion. A heat-seeking surface-to-air missile had gone into the exhaust and knocked off the helicopter's tail boom. The helicopter crashed, killing Kimberly.\nKimberly's Flight is the story of Captain Hampton's exemplary life. This story is told through nearly fifty interviews and her own e-mails to family and friends, and is entwined with Ann Hampton's narrative of loving and losing a child.","title_az":"Kimberly's Flight: The Story of Captain Kimberly Hampton, Americas First Woman Combat Pilot Killed in Battle","rank":687561.0,"category":"Leaders&amp;NotablePeople"},{"isbn":"075351009X","asin":null,"title_gr":"Diaries of an Internet Lover: What Really Happens When Naughty Girls Date","author_name":"Dawn Porter","top_genre":"books-i-own","publisher":"Virgin Books","publication_year":2006.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":256.0,"average_rating":3.29,"ratings_count":119.0,"text_reviews_count":21.0,"description":"Dawn Porter needed to take action to meet some new, exciting and hopefully sexy people.

Drawing on archeological findings, previously published only in Chinese, indicating how the I Ching was actually used by those who created it, and motivated by a lifetime of personal use and fascination, Kerson Huang has created a new translation of great significance.\nRestoring the I Ching to its original form, Huang underscores its first use as a practical oracle by Chinese farmers. His translation beautifully preserves the starkly poetic voice of the original, while his comments clearly and simply explain the images and detail the historical references buried within the verse. Huang reveals the I Ching as an epic poem equivalent to The Iliadand The Odyssey--one hexagram recalls the dethroning of Feng Feng; a series of lines portray Wang Hai, one of the three High Ancestors of the Shang dynasty; a third contains a sage proclamation of Lord Tang.\nEach hexagram and its corresponding interpretation is presented on a two-page spread, making this version unusually easy to use and understand. Introductory chapters detail the evolution of the I Ching, from the philosophical reinterpretations of Confucius to the modern musings of Carl Jung, and clearly explain both the coin method and yarrow-stalk method for consulting the oracle.\nOver 55,000 copies in print.","title_az":"I Ching","rank":1995466.0,"category":"OtherEasternReligions&SacredTexts"},{"isbn":"0820702455","asin":null,"title_gr":"Totality and Infinity:  An Essay on Exteriority","author_name":"Emmanuel Levinas","top_genre":"philosophy","publisher":"Duquesne","publication_year":1969.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":314.0,"average_rating":4.18,"ratings_count":1209.0,"text_reviews_count":36.0,"description":"Influenced in part by the dialogical philosophies of Franz Rosenzweig and Martin Buber, Totality and Infinity departs from the ethically neutral tradition of ontology to analyze the face-to-face relation with the Other.

Somewhere between a tragedy and a myth, a place and a condition, the term is perhaps best understood as a metaphor. It has been used and abused in academia by proponents of opposing political views. Multiculturalism has appropriated it, as have postmodernism and postcommunism. It is used pejoratively to refer to excessive specialization and nostalgically to refer to Europe's lost people -- its wild warriors and passionate geniuses. This book explores the idea of the Balkan as metaphor and the meaning of Balkan identity in the context of contemporary culture. Focusing on Balkanism both as a body of knowledge and as the critical study of that discourse, this book does for the Balkans what Edward Said's Orientalism did for \"the Orient.\"The sixteen authors, most of whom were born and educated in the Balkans, apply the Western academic tools of postmodernism, poststructuralism, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, and critical multiculturalism to topics as varied as the rhetoric of Balkanization, the war in Kosovo, Western demonization and erotization of the Serbs, Balkan film, human rights legislation, Byzantinism, the vampire as an image of Balkan violence, envy of the political and moral capital of victimhood, the tendency of the Balkan psyche toward depression, Serbian machismo and homosexuality, and wartime rape. The book both lays the groundwork for a new field of study and serves as an act of resistance against the many forms of representation that break the Balkans into fragments such as NATO army bases and digital maps in order to wire them into the global market.","title_az":"Balkan as Metaphor: Between Globalization and Fragmentation (The MIT Press)","rank":1877441.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"0446177954","asin":null,"title_gr":"100 Poems to Lift Your Spirits","author_name":"Leslie Pockell","top_genre":"poetry","publisher":"Popular Library","publication_year":2008.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":210.0,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":38.0,"text_reviews_count":7.0,"description":"No matter what the occasion, this collection of poems is the perfect gift to cheer up a friend or family member.

She conceals her ignorance beneath a show of independence, and becomes pregnant as a result of a one night stand. Although single parenthood is still not socially acceptable, she chooses to have the baby rather than to seek an illegal abortion, and finds her life transformed by motherhood.

While the cause of death is clear, the officer's identity is not. With nerve ends raw from the media focus on recent scandals, the Pentagon bypasses its own investigative service and appoints a commander, Dan Collins, and a civilian, Grace Snow, to conduct an inquiry. Together they resolve to ignore the Navy's political sensitivities and conduct a by-the-book murder investigation. But then they uncover evidence that points back to Washington, D.C., and a two-year-old unsolved case involving another black Navy lieutenant, a beautiful young woman, who died under violent circumstances.

Jasmine Lee O'Neill, autistic herself, perceives the creativity, imagination and keenly-felt sensory world of the autistic person as gifts. She argues that 'normalizing' autistic people - pushing them into behaving in a way that is alien to their true natures - is not just ineffective but wrong. In this vivid and enjoyable book, she challenges the reader to accept their difference and to celebrate their uniqueness.\nThe book contains a wealth of insight into the autistic world and the author covers all the main topics of most concern for people with autism. She identifies the reasons for particular characteristic behaviour and is both clear and sensitive about whether, and if how so, the autistic person should be encouraged to adapt such behaviours. Drawn from her own experience, she has many suggestions for ways in which the 'normal' world can shape itself to work around the behavioural characteristics of autistic people.\nHer book is for anyone who is interested in learning more about autism, including families and friends of autistic people, doctors and therapists, and all those who work with them.

These soldiers, sailors, and Marines have risked their lives several times over for their country as well as for their fellow troops and civilians. Still, until now, their stories have largely gone unnoticed by the public, perhaps lost in the frenzied and often nasty debate surrounding those conflicts. As the author writes, This generation does not have an Audie Murphy. I set out to change that with this book. Detailing incredible and evocative feats including an Army pilot who rescued two fellow pilots from a deadly crash in hostile territory and strapped himself to the helicopter s exterior for the flight to the hospital Greenblatt provides glimpses into the minds of these men as they face gut-wrenching decisions and overcome enormous odds. However, this book is much more than tales of riveting action. Each chapter goes beyond linear combat stories to explore each hero s motivations, dreams, and the genuine emotions that were evoked in the face of extreme danger. Readers will be transported to a variety of settings from close-quarters urban fighting in Iraq to mountainside ambushes in rural Afghanistan to a midnight rescue in the middle of the Atlantic as they accompany the men who do not see themselves as heroes but as patriots in the line of duty.\"","title_az":"Valor: Unsung Heroes from Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Home Front","rank":589846.0,"category":"Leaders&NotablePeople"},{"isbn":"3540653678","asin":null,"title_gr":"Approximation Algorithms","author_name":"Vijay V.

Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) Most natural optimization problems, including those arising in important application areas, are NP-hard. Therefore, under the widely believed con jecture that P -=\/= NP, their exact solution is prohibitively time consuming. Charting the landscape of approximability of these problems, via polynomial time algorithms, therefore becomes a compelling subject of scientific inquiry in computer science and mathematics. This book presents the theory of ap proximation algorithms as it stands today. It is reasonable to expect the picture to change with time. This book is divided into three parts. In Part I we cover combinato rial algorithms for a number of important problems, using a wide variety of algorithm design techniques. The latter may give Part I a non-cohesive appearance. However, this is to be expected - nature is very rich, and we cannot expect a few tricks to help solve the diverse collection of NP-hard problems. Indeed, in this part, we have purposely refrained from tightly cat egorizing algorithmic techniques so as not to trivialize matters. Instead, we have attempted to capture, as accurately as possible, the individual character of each problem, and point out connections between problems and algorithms for solving them.\"","title_az":"Approximation Algorithms","rank":760450.0,"category":"Programming"},{"isbn":"0321358287","asin":null,"title_gr":"Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms","author_name":"Anany V.

If this \"Brotherhood\" can forecast events like Hurricane Katrina, millions of dollars could be saved-for the elect few, of course. C Q Scafidi's murder story is in fact a stunning expose of globalism, greed and ritualized gangsterism. His background in journalism and business at the World Trade Center give him a unique insight into the workings of mankind... and how human nature can be corrupted overnight by the allure of power. Read Time Couriers and you'll see world events in an entirely different light. C Q Scafidi currently resides in the New Orleans area. His lifelong pursuits in international business, transportation, journalism and communications have provided him with a wealth of information to craft this novel, where arcane ritual enables global domination for a select few.","title_az":"Time Couriers","rank":2306360.0,"category":"Action&Adventure"},{"isbn":"1572972181","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Crow: City of Angels","author_name":"Chet Williamson","top_genre":"the-crow","publisher":"Berkley","publication_year":1996.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":250.0,"average_rating":3.52,"ratings_count":82.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":"Vengeance never sleeps.

And all parents long to figure out just who their child will become when he or she grows up. But with websites, media, and other parents providing an endless stream of advice about how to raise a perfect and perfectly happy child, how can you really know whom to trust? \nSusan Engel draws on her years of experience as a developmental psychologist, educator, and mother to help parents stop worrying about their young children's future and stop trying to control their formative years. Offering an intriguing new way of thinking about child development, she uses both personal and professional research to identify problematic behaviors that require intervention and gives reassurance about those that don't. Unlike many parenting experts, Engel encourages perspective and acceptance: rambunctious children will calm down as they find activities to absorb their intellectual energy; similarly, as shy kids grow, they will learn how to reach out to others on a one-to-one level. \nEngel provides straightforward guidance about issues of major concern for parents--happiness, intelligence, love, and morality--while blending stories about real children with relevant and up-to-the-minute social and clinical research. This absorbing narrative is an indispensable tool that will restore your sanity, help you sleep better, and put the joy back in child-raising.","title_az":"Your Child's Path: Unlocking the Mysteries of Who Your Child Will Become","rank":3437356.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"1940559995","asin":null,"title_gr":"Poisoned Web (Deizian Empire, #2)","author_name":"Crista McHugh","top_genre":"fantasy","publisher":"Crista McHugh","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":278.0,"average_rating":4.02,"ratings_count":93.0,"text_reviews_count":17.0,"description":"Book 2 of the Deizian Empire\nThe fate of the empire hangs on one slave breaking her silence...\nAs the Deizian Empire prepares for the upcoming wedding of Emperor Titus Sergius Flavus and Azruha, one mystery remains unsolved--the sudden and unexplained death of the former emperor. And as her wedding gift to Titus, Azurha wants to give him answers.

Now Henry and Frances McCallum have sought to assess barbed wire in the actual settlement of a continent.\nReduced to its simplest terms, barbed wire changed not only American but world-wide concepts of enclosure. Before its invention in 1873, fences were intended to keep animals and trespassers out; after it came into general use, barbed-wire fencing was used to keep animals in. The social and economic consequences, particularly in the competing landholding concepts of cattleman and small settler, may readily be surmised.\nAt the heart of this chronicle of \"bob \\\\A-ire\" is the story of three men, who happened to meet and become interested together in a curious sample of armored fencing shown at the i87;3 county fair in De Kalb, Illinois. Each of the three-Joseph F. Glidden, L L. Ellwood, and Jacob Haish- applied for a patent on separate types of wire fencing with barbs, and a new industry was born. By 1900 more than four hundred United States patents had been issued on barbed-wire fencing. Thirty-six of the most important types are described here in detail, with drawings which accompany the text.\nBut what barbed wire did is in some senses more important than what it was. The hitherto unfenced West, far-ranging, free-ranging, the homeland of big livestock men and the romantic cowboy, began swiftly to fence itself-not, however, without a measure of violence. The ensuing revolution in enclosure is an important part of the story of Western development.","title_az":"The Wire That Fenced the West","rank":1800274.0,"category":null},{"isbn":"019955398X","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","author_name":"Carlo Collodi","top_genre":"children-s","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.86,"ratings_count":28.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":"The story of the wooden puppet who learns goodness and becomes a real boy is famous the world over, and has been familiar in English for over a century. From the moment Joseph the carpenter carves a puppet that can walk and talk, this wildly inventive fantasy takes Pinocchio through countless adventures, in the course of which his nose grows whenever he tells a lie, he is turned into a donkey, and is swallowed by a dogfish, before he gains real happiness.\nThis new translation does full justice to the vibrancy and wit of Collodi's original. Far more sophisticated, funny, and hard-hitting than the many abridged versions (and the sentimentalized film) of the story would suggest, Ann Lawson Lucas's translation captures the complexity of Collodi's word-play, slapstick humour, and immediacy of dialogue.

But we're here to help....\nHelen is waking to a dark new reality--one that she's certain she didn't choose. In this borrowed existence, she finds an unexpected guide in Judy, a geisha-faced virgin who's on a mission of her own. Together, the two of them begin a dangerous run through dozens of imagined worlds in an attempt to trap a psychopath haunting the shadowed areas of virtual space--a killer who brutally murdered an earlier version of Helen and who plans to kill again. Meanwhile, Justinian is investigating a peculiar rash of AI suicides on far-off planets--and finds that not only is there more to these \"deaths\" than he thought, but that they may be linked to his wife Anya's mysterious coma.\nIn a future where AIs have taken over human life and the Environment Agency runs everything for our own good, the fact that we can live on after physical death as sentient digital beings should have been a good thing.

Now, however, conversation has turned to whether it's necessary to have it all or, perhaps more controversial, whether children are really a requirement for a fulfilling life. The idea that some women and men prefer not to have children is often met with sharp criticism and incredulity by the public and mainstream media.\nIn this provocative and controversial collection of essays, curated by writer Meghan Daum, sixteen acclaimed writers explain why they have chosen to eschew parenthood. Contributors Lionel Shriver, Sigrid Nunez, Kate Christiensen, Elliott Holt, Geoff Dyer, and Tim Kreider, among others, offer a unique perspective on the overwhelming cultural pressure of parenthood.\nSelfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbedmakes a thoughtful and passionate case for why parenthood is not the only path in life, taking our parent-centric, kid-fixated, baby-bump-patrolling culture to task in the process. What emerges is a more nuanced, diverse view of what it means to live a full, satisfying life.","title_az":"Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids","rank":604366.0,"category":"Essays&amp;Correspondence"},{"isbn":"1556593740","asin":null,"title_gr":"Happy Life","author_name":"David Budbill","top_genre":"poetry","publisher":"Copper Canyon Press","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":160.0,"average_rating":4.17,"ratings_count":50.0,"text_reviews_count":14.0,"description":"\"David Budbill is a no-nonsense free-range sage who celebrates tomatoes in September, the whistle of a woodcock and sweet black tea and ancient Chinese poems.\" --New York Times\"Budbill both informs and moves.

Scott Bakker's first novel, the beginning of a large-scale, swords and magic fantasy trilogy. It's a book with historical depth by an author as interested in exploring the philosophy of his world as its violent, conflicted politics. The novel begins a bit slowly as we're introduced to the characters and the world they live in. There's Kellhus, a warrior-monk from a city hidden away for 2000 years, and Achamian, a sorcerer and spy from the Mandate school, whose members all have recurring nightmares of an ancient war. There's an emperor who longs for godhood, a barbarian warlord, and assorted other schemers. And lingering in the background is something truly evil.\nWhen a newly arisen leader declares Holy War, the story brings everyone together. From that moment, the narrative takes off, and Bakker's prose carries the story right along. There's a fair amount of graphic violence, broken up by occasional flashes of humour. Bakker is working a combination that's currently also being explored by Steven Erikson and Sean McMullen: big fantasy worlds with long, deep histories, and characters who can think as well as act. It's a potent mix that elevates The Darkness That Comes Beforewell above most of its competition and bodes well for the rest of the series. --Greg L.

The more curious symptoms, such as the involuntary use of profanities, have caught the attention of the public and have baffled physicians who are still seeking scientific explanations. In spite of the attention paid to Tourette's syndrome in recent years, there is still no book which explains the condition to patients and their families in an informative, comprehensive, and accessible manner. This book fills that need. It presents factual information on all important aspects of TS along with a composite case history. The story of Michael Lockman, who typifies the average child with TS, is woven into the factual text which contains information on symptomatology, diagnosis, natural history, biochemistry, genetics, associated disorders, treatment and related topics. The authors have purposely chosen to portray a relatively mild case of TS since the majority of cases are mild, yet the more severe symptoms of TS are also introduced in the course of the story. Much of the value of the story lies in the way it presents Tourette's syndrome and its associated disorders in the context of everyday experience. Presenting information never before available in one source, this book will be invaluable to anyone concerned with this disorder including those suffering from TS and their families.","title_az":"A Mind of Its Own: Tourette's Syndrome: a Story and a Guide","rank":3065131.0,"category":"Medicine&HealthSciences"},{"isbn":"1600080243","asin":null,"title_gr":"Notorious 92: Indiana's Most Heinous Murders in All 92 Counties","author_name":"Andrew E.

On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester's Mills, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener's hand is severed as \"the Dome\" comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact.

To the west, theaters and shops frame posh houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. To the east lies a neighborhood still recovering from urban decline. In the center of the community sits Ilios Lane, a pristine cul-de-sac dotted with quiet homes that bridge the surrounding extremes of wealth and poverty.\nOn the first warm day in April, Mary Elizabeth McPherson, a lifelong resident of Ilios Lane, skips school with her friend Sofia. As the two experiment with a heavy dose of ecstasy in Mary Elizabeth's dining room, a series of home invasions rocks their neighborhood. At first the community is determined to band together, but rising suspicions soon threaten to destroy the world they were attempting to create. Filtered through a vibrant pinwheel of characters, Snyder's tour de force evokes the heightened tension of a community on edge as it builds toward one of the most explosive conclusions in recent fiction.

Adopting a people-centered view of Japan's post Cold War history and the US-Japan relationship, the authors focus on the fifteen-year Okinawan struggle to secure the return of Futenma Marine Corps Air Station, situated in the middle of a bustling residential area, from US to Okinawan control. They also highlight the Okinawan resistance to the US and Japanese governments' plan to build a substitute new base at Henoko, on the environmentally sensitive northeastern shore of Okinawa. Forty years after Okinawa's belated \"return\" to Japan from direct US rule, its people reject the ongoing military role assigned their islands, under which they are required to continue to attach priority to US strategy. In a persistent and deepening resistance without precedent in Japan's modern history, a peripheral and oppressed region stands up against the central government and its global superpower ally. One recent prime minister who tried to meet key Okinawan demands was brought down by bureaucratic and political pressure from Tokyo and Washington. His successors struggle in vain to find a formula that will allow them to meet US demands but also assuage Okinawan anger. Okinawa becomes a beacon of citizen democracy as its struggles raise key issues about popular sovereignty, democracy and human rights, and the future of Japan and the Asia-Pacific.","title_az":"Resistant Islands: Okinawa Confronts Japan and the United States (Asia\/Pacific\/Perspectives)","rank":2682813.0,"category":"Humanities"},{"isbn":"1451687222","asin":null,"title_gr":"Beautiful Inside and Out: Conquering Thyroid Disease with a Healthy, Happy, \"Thyroid Sexy\" Life","author_name":"Gena Lee Nolin","top_genre":"health","publisher":"Atria Books","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":336.0,"average_rating":4.07,"ratings_count":83.0,"text_reviews_count":10.0,"description":"Baywatchstar Gena Lee Nolin shares her story of undergoing and overcoming two decades of misdiagnosed thyroid disease and shows how the estimated sixty million Americans suffering from thyroid disease can learn to live healthy, happy, and beautiful lives.\nThe most comprehensive, user-friendly handbook available for anyone suffering from thyroid disease: everything you need to know to reclaim the happy, healthy, wonderful life you deserve!\nGena Lee Nolin, a star of the hit TV series Baywatch, was the picture of perfect health.

One side argues that vaccines are a necessary public health measure that protects children against dangerous and potentially deadly diseases. The other side vociferously maintains that vaccines are nothing more than a sop to pharmaceutical companies, and that the diseases they allegedly help prevent are nothing more than minor annoyances. An ordinary parent may have no idea where to turn to find accurate information. Your Baby s Best Shot is written for the parent who does not have a background in science, research, or medicine, and who is confused and overwhelmed by the massive amount of information regarding the issue of child vaccines. New parents are worried about the decisions that they are making regarding their children s health, and this work helps them wade through the information they receive in order to help them understand that vaccinating their child is actually one of the simplest and smartest decisions that they can make. Covering such topics as vaccine ingredients, how vaccines work, what can happen when populations don t vaccinate their children, and the controversies surrounding supposed links to autism, allergies, and asthma, the authors provide an overview of the field in an easy to understand guide for parents. In an age when autism diagnoses remain on the rise, when a single infectious individual can help spark an epidemic in three countries, when doctors routinely administer an often bewildering array of shots, and when parents swear their babies were fine until their first dosage of the MMR, the authors hope this book will serve as a crucial resource to help parents understand this vitally important issue.\"","title_az":"Your Baby's Best Shot: Why Vaccines Are Safe and Save Lives","rank":2045386.0,"category":"Medicine&amp;HealthSciences"},{"isbn":"1940857031","asin":null,"title_gr":"Sleeping Dogs","author_name":"Tony Vanderwarker","top_genre":"thriller","publisher":"New Shelves Publishing Services","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":352.0,"average_rating":4.12,"ratings_count":13.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"What if terrorists got their hands on one of the eleven nukes lost in the U.S. during the Cold War and never recovered?

This book, by her mother Jean MacColl, charts with moving insight Kirsty's early years, celebrates her brilliant career at the front rank of the music business in the 1980s and 1990s, and mourns her tragic and untimely death--killed by a speedboat in Mexican waters in December 2000. It also tells, with heartfelt truth, the shocking story of the elaborate cover-up and gross miscarriage of justice that followed, and appeals for justice to be done in her name. Daughter of legendary folksinger Ewan MacColl and dancer Jean, Kirsty was a precocious child, troubled by ill health, whose talent quickly blossomed into a unique artistry. She signed to the Stiff Records label and after her first tentative success moved to Polydor, which brought her her first major airplay with \"There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis,\" demonstrating Kirsty's trademark dry wit and social awareness. Top-ten success--and widespread acclaim as a musical postergirl of the times--followed with such hits as \"A New England\" and \"Days\", but it was her 1987 collaboration with The Pogues on the Christmas hit \"Fairytale of New York\" which really brought her brand of feisty folk-pop to an international audience. By then married to producer Steve Lillywhite, her talents lent magic to an astonishing array of creative collaborations; this book includes new reflections on her life by many of her friends and colleagues, including Jools Holland and Billy Bragg. In 2006 Bono dedicated U2's Mexico concert performances of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" to Kirsty's memory. But Kirsty's family, friends, and fans still haven't found what they're looking for--justice for those responsible for the needless hit-and-run accident that took her life. Soon after Kirsty's death, Jean and her friend and colleague John Dalby started the Justice for Kirsty Campaign, which has now grown into a worldwide organization, ably spearheaded by human rights activist Fred Shortland. The campaign will continue until justice is done. Meanwhile, Kirsty's vivacious personality lives on in the enduring legacy of her brilliant music. This remarkable book--in equal parts a celebration and an appeal for truth--tells the story of both.","title_az":"Sun on the Water: The Brilliant Life and Tragic Death of Kirsty Maccoll","rank":4432065.0,"category":"Music"},{"isbn":"0486211452","asin":null,"title_gr":"Woodcraft and Camping","author_name":"George Washington Sears","top_genre":"misc","publisher":"Dover Publications","publication_year":1963.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":128.0,"average_rating":3.96,"ratings_count":197.0,"text_reviews_count":20.0,"description":"One of America's most famous woodsmen and nature experts provides classic instructions for roughing it.

To bring the reader up to speed with the RCA de Cherisey discusses the years after Bokassa, a new political rule, the effects on the army and the relationship with France all the way to Operation Almandin I, II and III.

The sexual contract is ignored and thus men's patriarchal right over women is also glossed over. No attention is paid to the problems that arise when women are excluded from the original contract but incorporated into the new contractual order.\nOne of the main targets of the book is those who try to turn contractarian theory to progressive use, and a major thesis of the book is that this is not possible. Thus those feminists who have looked to a more \"proper\" contract- one between genuinely equal partners, or one entered into without any coercion- are misleading themselves. In the author's words, \"In contract theory universal freedom is always a hypothesis, a story, a political fiction. Contract always generates political right in the forms of domination and subordination.\" Thus the book is also aimed at mainstream political theorists, and socialist and other critics of contract theory.\nThe author offers a sweeping challenge to conventional understandings- of both left and right- of actual contracts in everyday life: the marriage contract, the employment contract, the prostitution contract, and the new surrogate mother contract. By bringing a feminist perspective to bear on the contradictions and paradoxes surrounding women and contract, and the relation between the sexes, she is able to shed new light on fundamental political problems of freedom and subordination.","title_az":"The Sexual Contract","rank":418919.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"0545132703","asin":null,"title_gr":"Wish Upon A Star (How I Survived Middle School, #11)","author_name":"Nancy E.

The popular second born son of a middle class family in Southern California, Nathan is a generous, intelligent, inventive and charismatic kid whose bold love for life seems to promise an extraordinary future. With the advent of adolescence, however, Nathan's world begins to unravel. Trips into normal adolescent defiance and confusion from which most of us return relatively unscathed do not stop for Nathan at the expected terminals. Instead, his ride relentlessly gathers speed until his adolescence becomes a runaway train of drug abuse, delinquency and ultimately membership in a criminal street gang. The institutions that should be sources of support and strength, including his family, friends, schools, sports, counselors and others seem only stoke the coals for his headlong rush into self-destruction. As he drives ever deeper into an abyss, his family futilely chases him, trying to pull him back before it is too late. In spite of all efforts, Nathan runs off the rails at full throttle, ultimately coming to a hard stop when he finds himself staring at the business end of Officer Trejo's sidearm. At seventeen years old, Nathan Frank is arrested for his participation in a botched robbery. Amazingly, even though no one is harmed during the crime, he is tried as an adult and sentenced to 32 years, plus two consecutive life sentences. But that is not the end, nor is it the entirety of Nathan Frank's story. How does a juvenile who does not hurt anyone end up being sentenced to multiple life terms in prison? The answer lies in the inhumane spirit that is pervasive throughout our justice system. With a near single focus on punishment and condemnation, our justice system incarcerates more people per capita than any country in history, by a long shot. The cost is enormous, but the benefits are slight as our crime rates exceed those of most developed countries and our rates of r","title_az":"Destructive Justice: A Lost Boy, a Broken System and the Small Light of Hope","rank":3955492.0,"category":"GenreFiction"},{"isbn":"1625490283","asin":null,"title_gr":"Words for House Story","author_name":"JoAnn Balingit","top_genre":"favorites","publisher":"Wordtech Communications","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":80.0,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":11.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"With a gift for metaphor and an eye for what is strange and arresting in everyday life, JoAnn Balingit weds intimate family narratives with radiant lyric poetry about loss, passion, parenthood and a life grounded in the natural world. \"JoAnn Balingit's WORDS FOR HOUSE STORY, celebrates the house of our longings, our memory, and our hopes.

So with renewed dedication, he goes knocking on the office door at Boathouse Row to reenroll as a member of the Windsor Club.\nCharlie Ashburn, whom Dr. Fenimore knows from medical school, is running the club, and they catch up on lost time. Charlie's son, Chuck, is a great rower and is currently training for the big regatta. Talking about Chuck makes Charlie swell with pride, but it makes Fenimore a little uneasy. Charlie was an incredibly talented rower himself but had to give it up because of a serious heart condition.\nDr. Fenimore doesn't enjoy his membership for very long before he finds himself drawn into an Ashburn family problem. Charlie's wife comes to his office in secret and begs him to talk to Charlie about getting their son checked out by a doctor. To Dr. Fenimore's surprise, Charlie has been refusing to face the possibility that Chuck might have inherited the same heart defect he has. The doctor agrees to help, and his well-intentioned efforts put his own life at risk.\nIn this fifth Fenimore episode, Robin Hathaway captures Philadelphia's exciting rowing scene and proves once again that when this doctor is in, it's great fun for all.","title_az":"The Doctor Rocks the Boat","rank":1726372.0,"category":"Mystery"},{"isbn":"0735201447","asin":null,"title_gr":"Trading in the Zone: Master the Market with Confidence, Discipline, and a Winning Attitude","author_name":"Mark Douglas","top_genre":"trading","publisher":"Prentice Hall Press","publication_year":2001.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":240.0,"average_rating":4.12,"ratings_count":1215.0,"text_reviews_count":79.0,"description":"Douglas uncovers the underlying reasons for lack of consistency and helps traders overcome the ingrained mental habits that cost them money.

Clare Longrigg gets to the heart of this complex existence in No Questions Asked, an investigation of the real women in today's American Mafia.Longrigg delved into the hidden depths of America mob society and discovered a subculture of powerful women in the midst of the Mafia patriarchy. From New Jersey to Chicago, Miami to LA, she interviewed the wives, mothers, daughters, and mistresses of \"made men\" to find out how they functioned in this deadly underworld. Some are irresistible attracted to dangerous menlike Camille Serpico, who married her first husband's killer, and Lana Zanicchio, daughter of the reputed Bonanno family consigliere, who calls her terrifying father a \"real man.\" Others, like Brenda Colletti, take part in criminal activities alongside their men, covering up for them with the police and plotting mob hits. And there are those who rebel, like Betty Tocco: to save her own son from a life of crimes, she conspired with the Feds to send her mob boss of a husband to jail for two hundred years.\nLongrigg profiles this fascinating cast of characters and their sacrifices, as well as their own uses and abuses of power.

Fans of the author's insightful, graphic style will find it thriving in his latest work, a powerful tale driven by Bardessono's signature dark humor and gritty realism.

Gathered from psych wards, broken homes, and the streets, the dorm residents live with a variety of disabilities ranging from personality disorders to autism. Recovering from a devastating loss three years earlier, Daren's good at his job nonetheless, perhaps due to his peculiar yet hard-won accords with reality. Assisted by his coworkers - Heather Fox, an elegant authoritarian obsessed with keeping order, Alex Sawyer, Daren's oldest friend presently wrestling with a fierce bout of nymphomania, Janet Blueheart, an eco-warrior lesbian drawn to lost causes, Rebecca Morgan, a British expat hiding a desolate past in prostitution, and Casey West, a drifting bombshell haunted by dark memories of abuse - Daren soon discovers his peers are no less complicated or damaged than the kids under their supervision. He forms a precarious bond with Tara Martinez, a spitfire Latina hardened from a cycle of neglect in the violent barrios of central Los Angeles, and the Los Alamos crew may be her last chance before a transfer to a lockdown state hospital.

Trees are so entwined with human experience that diverse species have inspired their own stories, myths, songs, poems, paintings, and spiritual meanings. Some have achieved status as religious, cultural, or national symbols.\nIn this beautifully illustrated volume Fiona Stafford offers intimate, detailed explorations of seventeen common trees, from ash and apple to pine, oak, cypress, and willow. The author also pays homage to particular trees, such as the fabled Ankerwyke Yew, under which Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn, and the spectacular cherry trees of Washington, D.C. Stafford discusses practical uses of wood past and present, tree diseases and environmental threats, and trees' potential contributions toward slowing global climate change. Brimming with unusual topics and intriguing facts, this book celebrates trees and their long, long lives as our inspiring and beloved natural companions.","title_az":"The Long, Long Life of Trees","rank":474870.0,"category":"BiologicalSciences"},{"isbn":"0736074155","asin":null,"title_gr":"Nancy Clark's Sports Nutrition Guidebook","author_name":"Nancy Clark","top_genre":"nutrition","publisher":"Human Kinetics Publishers","publication_year":2008.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":461.0,"average_rating":4.02,"ratings_count":88.0,"text_reviews_count":7.0,"description":"Boost your energy, manage stress, build muscle, lose fat, and improve your performance with the all-time best-selling sports nutrition guide!\nNancy Clark's Sports Nutrition Guidebookwill help you make the right food choices in grocery stores, restaurants, drive-throughs, and your own kitchen.\nWhether you're preparing for competition or simply eating on the go, let sport's leading nutritionist show you how to get maximum benefit from the foods you choose and the meals you make.

They don't want their children to suffer a moment of frustration or be deprived of any desire. But in truth, a balance of frustration tolerance and gratification is necessary to become a resilient and responsible adult.\nOf course, every child is difficult on occasion, but true brats are constantly selfish, demanding, and incapable of listening. Their parents must regularly plead, cajole, and bargain with them to exert some control. So what makes a child become a brat in the first place? And what can a parent do--or not do--to keep their children from becoming brats?\nSince being a mother is her most important role, renowned actress Marilu Henner has often turned to Dr. Ruth Sharon, a highly respected psychoanalyst, for advice on raising her own children. Together, in I Refuse to Raise a Brat,they have created a practical and accessible guidebook based on Dr. Sharon's fundamental observation: Adults with the greatest emotional difficulties were generally overgratified, overprotected, and overindulged as children.\nConsequently, parents need to allow their children to work through their frustrations at an early age and not consistently indulge them. I Refuse to Raise a Bratwill show parents how to:\nEstablish parent--child contracts and effective methods of discipline\nHandle temper tantrums, bedtime issues, sibling rivalry, lying, and more\nHelp their children tolerate frustration and become comfortable with difficult feelings\nFilled with dozens of real-life questions, practical advice, and humorous anecdotes, I Refuse to Raise a Bratis a witty and uniquely helpful resource to help parents raise secure and self-reliant children.","title_az":"I Refuse to Raise a Brat: Straightforward Advice on Parenting in an Age of Overindulgence","rank":3686702.0,"category":"HomeImprovement&amp;Design"},{"isbn":"0521835402","asin":null,"title_gr":"Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis","author_name":"Michael Mitzenmacher","top_genre":"computer-science","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publication_year":2005.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":370.0,"average_rating":4.05,"ratings_count":38.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"Assuming only an elementary background in discrete mathematics, this textbook is an excellent introduction to the probabilistic techniques and paradigms used in the development of probabilistic algorithms and analyses.

In this charming collection of stories, essays, anecdotes, and recollections, knitters of every \"color\" celebrate their hobby and share with you the joy it brings into their lives.\nFrom the touching tale of a caring woman whose hand-knit dolls bring security to young hospital patients, to the hilarious story of a woman scorned who sends her ex-boyfriend a scarf knit with wolf hair only to have it torn to shreds by his dogs, to the moving recollection of a man whose grandmother's dying wish was to knit all the wool in her knitting stash, to the finely wrought account of a man who keeps alive the memories of his companions and friends who have succumbed to AIDS by wearing the sweaters they left behind, KnitLit is a gift from knitters to knitters--crafted with as much love and care as an afghan or a wool scarf. Wrap yourself in KnitLit, and be inspired.","title_az":"KnitLit: Sweaters and Their Stories...and Other Writing About Knitting","rank":1523906.0,"category":"Crafts&amp;Hobbies"},{"isbn":"1884772021","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Cause and Cure of Human Illness","author_name":"Arnold Ehret","top_genre":"health-and-vegan","publisher":"Ehret Literature Publications","publication_year":2001.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":159.0,"average_rating":4.48,"ratings_count":23.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"Written over 100 years ago, Ehret offers timeless insight into how to achieve true strength, health, vitality, and happiness.

Will your faith hold up against the chaos in your life, in your community, in your world? Is your walk with Jesus Christ one of complete trust in Him? Can God count on you in these last days to do the unthinkable, the remarkable, and even the inexplicable? How far are you willing to go for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus? Going to church every Sunday and being busy with church stuff is not an indication of the depth of one's faith. Those of us who confess Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior have not been saved merely to exist but to call our faith into action as He wills, in accordance with His Word. FaithMarkers gives a compelling explanation of the term \"faith\"-what it truly means. In addition, allow Noah, Abraham, Deborah, Job, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, Mary, and Paul-these biblical exemplars of faith-to encourage you to stand firm in the faith during these last days. Their faith experiences are powerful and convicting as well as humanly vulnerable and transparent. God has not changed; as these last days wind down to Jesus's return, He wants His relationship with us to be just as powerful, if not more so, as it was with those faithmarkers of antiquity.

It begins a thousand years ago in the time of the Vikings in Newfoundland. It is crammed with incidents of war and peace, with fights to the death and long nights of lovemaking, and with accounts of the rise of local clan chiefs and the silent fall of great distant empires. Out of the mists of the past it sweeps forward eight hundred years, to the lonely death of the last of the Beothuk.\nThe Beothuk, of course, were the original native people of Newfoundland, and thus the first North American natives encountered by European sailors. Noticing the red ochre they used as protection against mosquitoes, the sailors called them \"Red-skins,\" a name that was to affect an entire continent. As a people, they were never understood.\nUntil now. By adding his novelist's imagination to his knowledge as an anthropologist and a historian, Bernard Assiniwi has written a convincing account of the Beothuk people through the ages. To do so he has given us a mirror image of the history rendered by Europeans. For example, we know from the Norse Sagas that four slaves escaped from the Viking settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows. What happened to them? Bernard Assiniwi supplies a plausible answer, just as he perhaps solves the mystery of the Portuguese ships that sailed west in 1501 to catch more Beothuk, and disappeared from the paper records forever.\nThe story of the Beothuk people is told in three parts. \"The Initiate\" tells of Anin, who made a voyage by canoe around the entire island a thousand years ago, encountering the strange Vikings with their \"cutting sticks\" and their hair \"the colour of dried grass.\" His encounters with whales, bears, raiding Inuit and other dangers, and his survival skills on this epic journey make for fascinating reading, as does his eventual return to his home where, with the help of his strong and active wives, he becomes a legendary chief, the father of his people.","title_az":"The Beothuk Saga","rank":4017980.0,"category":"GenreFiction"},{"isbn":"1425365957","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Magic and Philosophy of Trithemius of Spanheim Containing His Book of Secret Things and Doctrine of Spirits","author_name":"Francis Barrett","top_genre":"occult","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.0,"ratings_count":2.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":null,"title_az":"The Magic And Philosophy Of Trithemius Of Spanheim Containing His Book Of Secret Things And Doctrine Of Spirits","rank":6985358.0,"category":"Occult&amp;Paranormal"},{"isbn":"1579656668","asin":null,"title_gr":"Savor: Rustic Recipes Inspired by Forest, Field, and Farm","author_name":"Ilona Oppenheim","top_genre":"cookbooks","publisher":"Artisan","publication_year":2016.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":272.0,"average_rating":3.74,"ratings_count":47.0,"text_reviews_count":19.0,"description":"\"Gorgeous. . . .

From her home in the mountains of Aspen, Colorado, Ilona Oppenheim devises recipes that make the best use of the abundance of her surroundings: foraged mushrooms and berries, fresh-caught fish, pasture-raised dairy, and home-milled flours. Oppenheim's recipes rely on quality ingredients and simple cooking techniques to make nutritious, family-centric dishes, including Kale and Feta Quiche, Ricotta and Roasted Fig Bruschetta, Vegetable Soup with Mini Meatballs, Porcini Fettuccine, Tomato Tart, Oatmeal Baked Apples, and Pear Crisp, among others. Many of these recipes call for only a handful of ingredients and require very few steps, resulting in dishes that are easy to make and fresh, wholesome, and delicious too.\nThis romantic and delicious portrayal of living in harmony with nature will appeal to gardeners, gatherers, foragers, and home cooks but will also transport the armchair reader straight to the forest.

Purely philosophical treatment of the concept is shown to be related to its use in the work of Coleridge and Wordsworth, who she considers to be the creators of a new kind of awareness with more than literary implications. The purpose of her historical account is to suggest that the role of imagination in our perception and thought is more pervasive than may at first sight appear, and that the thread she traces is an important link joining apparently different areas of our experience. She argues that imagination is an essential element in both our awareness of the world and our attaching of value to it.","title_az":"Imagination","rank":1876216.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"1492285692","asin":null,"title_gr":"Type Superwoman: Finding the Life in Work-Life Balance: A Self-Searching Book for Women","author_name":"Jaime Kulaga","top_genre":"NONFIC","publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":138.0,"average_rating":2.0,"ratings_count":1.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"The SuperWoman Workshops have empowered and helped women to reach goals, take responsibility for their lives and utilize tools to better their personal stories.

Can't afford to get married, buy a home, have children? At last, a book for the under-35 generation (and their parents) that explains why it is not their fault.\nStrappedoffers a groundbreaking look at the new obstacle course facing young adults--the under-35 crowd--as they try to build careers, buy homes, and start families. As Tamara Draut explains, getting ahead is getting harder. A college degree is the new high school diploma--but it now costs a fortune to get that degree, and students graduate with crippling debts. Good jobs are scarcer thanks to stagnant wages and disappearing benefits. And, the cost of everything--starter homes, health coverage, child care--keeps going up and up. Budding families, even those with two incomes, struggle to pay the bills, while Visa and Mastercard have become the new safety net. Young adults are starting out behind the financial eight ball--borrowing their way into adulthood and wondering whatever happened to the American Dream.\nIs this the way things have to be? Not at all, argues Tamara Draut, a leading young commentator and a fresh voice for change. She shows how the obstacle course bedeviling young adults didn't just happen--it was allowed to happen by a generation of leaders more interested in serving wealthy interests than in investing in the nation's future. Strappedbrims with ideas for a new kind of America where every young person can go to college, buy a home, and start a family.\nStrappedwill help jump-start a national conversation about where the country is failing--and how we can make it right again.","title_az":"Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead","rank":2853366.0,"category":"Economics"},{"isbn":"0749472383","asin":null,"title_gr":"How the Stock Market Works: A Beginner's Guide to Investment","author_name":"Michael Becket","top_genre":"finance","publisher":"Kogan Page","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":176.0,"average_rating":3.38,"ratings_count":24.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"Now more than ever, people are being affected by the fluctuations in the global economy and by financial uncertainty - with major impacts on their savings, portfolios and pensions.

Wiersema returns with this exquisitely plotted blend of supernatural thriller and domestic drama.\nFor novelist Christopher Knox, getting up early every morning to write isn't bringing him the sense of fulfillment it once did. It's been ten years since his first novel was published, to some acclaim, and he's hit a wall in trying to write his next. His marriage to Jacqui isn't doing much better, and it's been months since he's slept anywhere but his office above the detached garage.\nThe part of Chris's life that isgoing well, and brings him easy joy, is his relationship with his eleven-year-old son, David. While Chris may not make it to all of his son's ball games, their nightly ritual of reading together at bedtime not only helps David overcome his struggles with reading, but is a calm within the storm for them both, when their days are so full of challenges. And what better way for a novelist to connect with his child than through their mutual love of books, and a bedtime story routine as unwavering as Chris's love for his son.\nWhen Chris comes across a book by one of his favourite childhood authors in a local used bookstore, he knows it will be the perfect gift for David's birthday. To the Four Directionsis not one Chris has read before, but he knows that Lazarus Took's adventurous, magical stories of young heroes and other realms would be just the thing for David, as they were for him. David is less than thrilled to receive a book he's never heard of before, however - he'd been hoping for The Lord of the Rings- and Jacqui is quick to see it as yet another sign of Chris's detachment from David's life.\nBut once they start reading the novel together, David is completely enthralled, to the extent that he truly cannot put the book down. The story, of a young peasant boy who is plucked from his home by castle guards and sent on a quest for a mysterious Sunstone, makes David feel like he is right there, in the action. Even after his parents have to take the book away from him, he can't help but sneak it back to his room. As David is reading alone that night, he suffers an inexplicable seizure and falls into a state of unconsciousness. Doctors perform a barrage of tests, but cannot determine what's wrong. And as David's seizure recurs every night, his father learns that only one thing will calm it: being read to from his strange new book.\nTrue to his nature, as someone with an inherent belief in the power of words, Chris becomes convinced that the secret of David's collapse lies within the pages of To the Four Directions. After failed attempts to find out more about Lazarus Took from his estate, Chris traverses the continent in search of the truth. Meanwhile, David wakes up within the story he has been reading - as the boy he has been reading about - and finds himself facing perils unimaginable, in a world that he soon realizes was created to capture the hearts and souls of children like him. Because he's not alone as he takes over the hunt for the Sunstone, but accompanied by those boys who have come before him. And as the quests of father and son lead them toward a fateful collision of worlds, David realizes that while he's not the first to fall victim to the book's horrific spell, perhaps he can prove himself strong enough to be the last.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","title_az":"Bedtime Story","rank":5621872.0,"category":"Literature&amp;Fiction"},{"isbn":"0891342141","asin":null,"title_gr":"How to Draw and Sell-- Comic Strips-- For Newspapers and Comic Books!","author_name":"Alan McKenzie","top_genre":"art","publisher":"Northlight","publication_year":1987.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":143.0,"average_rating":3.71,"ratings_count":14.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"Aspiring cartoonists will find everything they need to transform their three-dimensional ideas into salable two-dimensional comic strips and books.","title_az":"How to Draw and Sell....Comic Strips....

In an age when prepackaged gospel formulations leave people cold, well-told Bible stories can be used powerfully by God to touch people's hearts and draw them to himself. After ministry in both Western and non-Western contexts, church planter Christine Dillon has discovered that Bible storying is far more effective than most other forms of apologetics or evangelistic presentations.

In Talking, Drawing, Writing: Lessons for Our Youngest WritersMartha Horn and Mary Ellen Giacobbe invite readers to join them in classrooms where they listen, watch, and talk with children, then use what they learn to create lessons designed to meet children where they are and lead them into the world of writing. The authors make a case for a broader definition of writing, advocating for formal storytelling sessions, in which children tell about what they know, and for focused sketching sessions so that budding writers learn how to observe more carefully.\nThe book's lessons are organized by topic and include oral storytelling, drawing, writing words, assessment, introducing booklets, and moving writers forward. Based on the authors' work in urban kindergarten and first-grade classes, the essence and structure of many of the lessons lend themselves to adaptation through fifth grade. The lessons follow a consistent format:what's going on in the classroom;what children need to learn next;the materials needed;the actual language used in the lesson;when children's literature is used, reasons for choosing the books and suggestions for other books;suggestions for other lessons.\nMartha and Mary Ellen show the thinking behind their teaching decisions and provide a way to look at and assess children's writing, giving us much more than a book of lessons; they present a vision of what beginning writing can look and sound like. Perhaps most powerfully, they give us examples of the language they use with children that reveal a genuine respect for and trust in children as learners.","title_az":"Talking, Drawing, Writing: Lessons for Our Youngest Writers","rank":464620.0,"category":"Research&amp;PublishingGuides"},{"isbn":"0995057109","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Professor: It's My First Book So Please Don't Laugh","author_name":"Pat Patenaude","top_genre":"UNK","publisher":"Patrick G.

In a new epilogue Bourgois brings up to date the stories of the people--Primo, Caesat, Luis, Tony, Candy--who readers come to know in this remarkable window onto the world of the inner city drug trade. Philippe Bourgois is Professor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He has conducted fieldwork in Central America on ethnicity and social unrest and is the author of Ethnicity at Work: Divided Labor on a Central American Banana Plantation (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989). He is writing a book on homeless heroin addicts in San Francisco. 1\/e hb ISBN (1996) 0-521-43518-8 1\/e pb ISBN (1996) 0-521-57460-9","title_az":"In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio (Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences)","rank":79479.0,"category":"Politics&amp;Government"},{"isbn":"0838910173","asin":null,"title_gr":"Writing Reviews for Readers' Advisory","author_name":"Brad Hooper","top_genre":"writing","publisher":"American Library Association","publication_year":2010.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":96.0,"average_rating":3.52,"ratings_count":58.0,"text_reviews_count":24.0,"description":"Reviews are an important resource for readers' advisory and collection development.

Most people have--few actually do. Quint not only considers ditching his cheating wife and dead-end job for a tropical escape, he does it--and heads for the Keys.\nAfter finishing two tours of duty as a Navy SEAL, Quint had longed for an ordinary life away from death and brutality. However, his post-service American dream becomes nothing more than a deep sleep, and he finds himself longing for a sense of purpose, a mission. He begins his new life tamely enough--as a charter boat captain in pursuit of the legal limits for his clients. But soon events converge to thrust Quint into a race to find the world's most valuable treasure while extracting himself from a shipwreck, rogue naval forces, and from the pursuit of a vile cadre of pirates and thieves, who are also committed to snatching the treasure from the grasp of ancient history\nor from anyone who gets in their way.\nThis fast-paced adventure starts in Mississippi then moves to the\nKeys. Soon Quint finds himself in Cay Sal looking for a lost Spanish galleon bearing the secret to an even bigger treasure.

But when it comes to the inescapable realities of aging and death, what medicine can do often runs counter to what it should.\nThrough eye-opening research and gripping stories of his own patients and family, Gawande reveals the suffering this dynamic has produced. Nursing homes, devoted above all to safety, battle with residents over the food they are allowed to eat and the choices they are allowed to make. Doctors, uncomfortable discussing patients' anxieties about death, fall back on false hopes and treatments that are actually shortening lives instead of improving them. And families go along with all of it.\nIn his bestselling books, Atul Gawande, a practicing surgeon, has fearlessly revealed the struggles of his profession. Now he examines its ultimate limitations and failures--in his own practices as well as others'--as life draws to a close. And he discovers how we can do better. He follows a hospice nurse on her rounds, a geriatrician in his clinic, and reformers turning nursing homes upside down. He finds people who show us how to have the hard conversations and how to ensure we never sacrifice what people really care about.\nRiveting, honest, and humane, Being Mortal shows that the ultimate goal is not a good death but a good life--all the way to the very end.\n~ penguinrandomhouse.ca","title_az":"Being Mortal","rank":1586280.0,"category":null},{"isbn":"0786711469","asin":null,"title_gr":"Black Cloud: The Great Florida Hurricane of 1928","author_name":"Eliot Kleinberg","top_genre":"history","publisher":null,"publication_year":2003.0,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":51.0,"text_reviews_count":7.0,"description":null,"title_az":"Black Cloud: The Great Florida Hurricane of 1928","rank":1478252.0,"category":"Americas"},{"isbn":"1421596938","asin":null,"title_gr":"Shiver: Junji Ito Selected Stories","author_name":"Junji Ito","top_genre":"to-buy-soon_comics","publisher":"VIZ Media LLC","publication_year":2017.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":392.0,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":3.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"A best-of story selection by the master of horror manga.\nThis volume includes nine of Junji Ito's best short stories, as selected by the author himself and presented with accompanying notes and commentary.

Once widely acknowledged as one of the world's foremost art dealers, Volpe launched a feeding frenzy in the international art community when he founded the Mission arts and crafts movement. He was rewarded with fabulous wealth, enormous influence, and a client list that included Andy Warhol, Jack Nicholson, and Bruce Willis. At the height of his success as \"Art Dealer to the Stars,\" Volpe self-destructed in a scandalous case of fraud that made headlines and threatened to blow the lid off the shadowy world of art dealing in a star-studded trial. Opting to remain silent, he pled guilty and spent two years in a federal prison. That silence has now been broken. Framed is a shocking account of how the life of one man who struggled to have it all spiraled out of control.

That's what New Mexico's favorite public relations maven, Sasha Solomon, can't figure out about her favorite niece. The daughter of Sasha's overbearing sister, Gabi is a grad student at Socorro's New Mexico Tech, where she's studying explosives technology. In town to help boost area tourism, Sasha looks forward to spending time with the young woman. But the PR pro never imagined it would be in the hospital, where Gabi lands after someone rigs her mailbox with a nasty surprise.\nJewish with an Iranian surname, Gabi could be the victim of a hate crime. But as details emerge about her work and personal relationships, she begins to appear less as a victim than as a threat. Meanwhile, Sasha learns that the family of her client, town patriarch Papi Sanchez, is riddled with secrets and scandal.\nAt once a topically flavored whodunit and a realistic portrayal of the way families join together--or don't--in a crisis, The Socorro Blastis a blend of mystery and domestic drama, with the flawed but always engaging Sasha Solomon on center stage.\n\"Lucky readers who enjoyed Pari Noskin Taichert's first two Sasha Solomon novels don't need to be told she's a first class writer.

The twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant colonel departed for the stars from within the shadowy world of the Soviet military-industrial complex. Barbed wires, no-entry placards, armed guards, false identities, mendacious maps, and a myriad of secret signs had hidden Gagarin from prying outsiders--not even his friends or family knew what he had been up to. Coming less than four years after the Russians launched Sputnik into orbit, Gagarin's voyage was cause for another round of capitalist shock and Soviet rejoicing.\nThe Cosmonaut Who Couldn't Stop Smilingrelates this twentieth-century icon's remarkable life while exploring the fascinating world of Soviet culture. Gagarin's flight brought him massive international fame--in the early 1960s, he was possibly the most photographed person in the world, flashing his trademark smile while rubbing elbows with the varied likes of Nehru, Castro, Queen Elizabeth II, and Italian sex symbol Gina Lollobrigida. Outside of the spotlight, Andrew L. Jenks reveals, his tragic and mysterious death in a jet crash became fodder for morality tales and conspiracy theories in his home country, and, long after his demise, his life continues to provide grist for the Russian popular-culture mill.\nThis is the story of a legend, both the official one and the one of myth, which reflected the fantasies, perversions, hopes and dreams of Gagarin's fellow Russians. With this rich, lively chronicle of Gagarin's life and times, Jenks recreates the elaborately secretive world of space-age Russia while providing insights into Soviet history that will captivate a range of readers.","title_az":"The Cosmonaut Who Couldn't Stop Smiling: The Life and Legend of Yuri Gagarin","rank":818560.0,"category":"Historical"},{"isbn":"0313384967","asin":null,"title_gr":"Stop Street Harassment: Making Public Places Safe and Welcoming for Women","author_name":"Holly Kearl","top_genre":"feminism","publisher":"Praeger Publisher","publication_year":2010.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":224.0,"average_rating":4.31,"ratings_count":24.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":"Street harassment is generally dismissed as harmless, but in reality, it causes women to feel unsafe in public, at least sometimes.

In the second half of the book, readers will find concrete strategies for dealing with street harassers and ways to become involved in working to end this all-too-common violation.

But what accounts for the incredible longevity of dinosaurs? A renowned scientist now provides a startling explanation that is rewriting the history of the Age of Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were pretty amazing creatures--real-life monsters that have the power to fascinate us. And their fiery Hollywood ending only serves to make the story that much more dramatic. But fossil evidence demonstrates that dinosaurs survived several mass extinctions, and were seemingly unaffected by catastrophes that decimated most other life on Earth. What could explain their uncanny ability to endure through the ages? Biologist and earth scientist Peter Ward now accounts for the remarkable indestructibility of dinosaurs by connecting their unusual respiration system with their ability to adapt to Earth's changing environment--a system that was ultimately bequeathed to their descendants, birds. By tracing the evolutionary path back through time and carefully connecting the dots from birds to dinosaurs, Ward describes the unique form of breathing shared by these two distant relatives and demonstrates how this simple but remarkable characteristic provides the elusive explanation to a question that has thus far stumped scientists. Nothing short of revolutionary in its bold presentation of an astonishing theory, Out of Thin Airis a story of science at the edge of discovery. Ward is an outstanding guide to the process of scientific detection. Audacious and innovative in his thinking, meticulous and thoroughly detailed in his research, only a scientist of his caliber is capable of telling this surprising story.","title_az":"Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere","rank":489287.0,"category":"BiologicalSciences"},{"isbn":"0786473541","asin":null,"title_gr":"Nightmares of an East Prussian Childhood: A Memoir of the Russian Occupation","author_name":"Ilse Stritzke","top_genre":"biographies","publisher":"McFarland & Company","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":4.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"The mother of 11 year old Ilse Glaus turned down the last plane out of East Prussia ahead of the advancing Russians in order to stay back with her aged parents.

That's how his mother envisions his impending reign. Aidan prefers to see it as decades of sitting in an uncomfortable chair listening to old men bicker over property lines and taxes.

In front of his parents and the entire kingdom, the sword rejects Aidan, leaving Torel without an heir. While Aidan struggles to find his place, an ancient evil awakens and provokes a war between Torel and the warrior tribes of the west.

By examining radiocarbon (C-14) dating--the best known of these methods--and several other techniques that geologists use to decode the distant past, Macdougall unwraps the last century's advances, explaining how they reveal the age of our fossil ancestors such as \"Lucy,\" the timing of the dinosaurs' extinction, and the precise ages of tiny mineral grains that date from the beginning of the earth's history. In lively and accessible prose, he describes how the science of geochronology has developed and flourished. Relating these advances through the stories of the scientists themselves--James Hutton, William Smith, Arthur Holmes, Ernest Rutherford, Willard Libby, and Clair Patterson--Macdougall shows how they used ingenuity and inspiration to construct one of modern science's most significant accomplishments: a timescale for the earth's evolution and human prehistory.","title_az":"Nature&rsquo;s Clocks: How Scientists Measure the Age of Almost Everything","rank":1441861.0,"category":"BiologicalSciences"},{"isbn":"0321884485","asin":null,"title_gr":"Mobile Usability","author_name":"Jakob Nielsen","top_genre":"ux","publisher":"New Riders Publishing","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":203.0,"average_rating":3.78,"ratings_count":95.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":"How do we create a satisfactory user experience when limited to a small device?

Eighty miles away in Sacramento, California, Wayne Thiebaud was making his first paintings of pies and cakes. In 1965 Crown Point Press published limited edition portfolios of prints by both artists, and the antique art of etching was set to become once again, as it had been for Picasso and Matisse, a favored printmaking medium for avant-garde artists. As curator Richard Field pointed out in 1975, Pop artists loved silkscreen and lithography, but what he called etching s cool appealed to newer artists searching for an instrument of intellect. Is this the Crown Point Press? Sol Le Witt inquired politely in 1971 as he grasped a porch railing to save himself from being swept downstairs by two big dogs. John Cage arrived at the press for the first time in 1978 and returned regularly until his death in 1992. He set fire to newspapers on the press bed to create some of his etchings. Kathan Brown s memoir, Know That You Are Lucky, is full of stories about art and artists, but it is also an engaging narrative about an adventurous approach to running a small business in the varying economic times of the past half-century. This has included a good deal of internationalism. Crown Point Press brought artists from Europe Daniel Buren from France, Jannis Kounellis from Italy, for example beginning in the late 1970s to work in California. In 1982 Crown Point began taking American artists to Japan, and later China, to work with craftsmen to make traditional woodcuts. In what Brown calls the new century the press has brought artists from Sweden, Switzerland, and China to work in etching in its San Francisco studio. The narrative in Know That You Are Lucky moves quickly, and in the end the author follows the advice of Sol Le Witt (used as one of its chapter titles): Leap to Conclusions that Logic Cannot Reach.","title_az":"Know That You Are Lucky","rank":704931.0,"category":"Memoirs"},{"isbn":"0813530385","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Democracy Owners' Manual: A Practical Guide to Changing the World","author_name":"Jim Shultz","top_genre":"us","publisher":"Rutgers University Press","publication_year":2002.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":256.0,"average_rating":4.17,"ratings_count":17.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"For citizens seeking to take an active role in the affairs of their community--whether improving local schools, forcing clean-up of a polluted river, or weighing in on the debate over economic globalization -- the challenge of activism can be daunting.

Cecylee is in her element. As the young king's mother, her views and opinions carry weight.\nBut Cecylee's contentment does not last long. Edward makes a disastrous marriage to Elisabeth Woodville, the poor widow of a Lancastrian knight, thus displacing Cecylee.

I have found myself . . . drawn to the task and yet somehow strangely resistant. On the one hand, I have been drawn to the task because my journey into solitude and silence has been the single most meaningful aspect of my spiritual life to date. . . . On the other hand, I am aware of the continuing challenge solitude and silence represent in my own life. Even though it has been well over ten years since I first said yes to God's invitations to enter more intentionally into these disciplines, I still find it challenging to protect space for these times apart which so deeply satisfy the empty places of my soul.Ruth Haley Barton describes how she has discovered the real presence of God--the God who is present through the practice of solitude and silence. Her book invites you to meet God deeply and fully outside the demands and noise of daily life. It is a call to the adventure of spiritual transformation--an adventure that will lead you to freedom and authenticity, allowing you to become the person God created you to be.In Invitation to Solitude and Silence Barton offers spiritual guidance for your journey, helping you to hear God's call more clearly and showing you concrete ways to say yes. Chapter by chapter she combines teaching and reflection on different aspects of the journey with activities and disciplines that will help you to practice solitude and silence. Barton offers the prophet Elijah as a biblical guide for your journey. And she offers her own perspective to help you understand the ups and downs you might experience along the way.The beauty of a true invitation is that you really do have a choice. You can say yes or no. God is waiting for you to respond to him from the depths of your desire for relationship, belonging and transformation. Will you say yes?","title_az":"Invitation to Solitude and Silence: Experiencing God's Transforming Presence","rank":1778284.0,"category":"ChristianLiving"},{"isbn":"0736427570","asin":null,"title_gr":"Aurora and the Helpful Dragon & Tiana and Her Furry Friend: 2 Books in 1","author_name":"Walt Disney Company","top_genre":"children-s","publisher":"RH\/Disney","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":32.0,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":12.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"The stars of two Disney Princess films--The Little Mermaidand The Princess and the Frog--are featured in one full-color 8 x 8 storybook that girls will love!

Practical Pursuits explores theories of personal development that were diffused in the early nineteenth century by a network of religious groups in the Edo (Tokyo) area, and explains how, after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the leading members of these communities went on to create ideological coalitions inspired by the pursuit of a modern form of cultivation. Variously engaged in divination, Shinto purification rituals, and Zen practice, these individuals ultimately used informal political associations to promote the Confucian-style assumption that personal improvement is the basis for national prosperity.\nThis wide-ranging yet painstakingly researched study represents a new direction in historical analysis. Where previous scholarship has used large conceptual units like Confucianism and Buddhism as its main actors and has emphasized the discontinuities in Edo and Meiji religious life, Sawada addresses the history of religion in nineteenth-century Japan at the level of individuals and small groups. She employs personal cultivation as an interpretive system, crossing familiar boundaries to consider complex linguistic, philosophical, and social interconnections.","title_az":"Practical Pursuits: Religion, Politics, and Personal Cultivation in Nineteenth-Century Japan","rank":1841998.0,"category":"World"},{"isbn":"1434400816","asin":null,"title_gr":"Swords of Talera (Talera Cycle #1)","author_name":"Charles Allen Gramlich","top_genre":"fantasy","publisher":"Borgo Press","publication_year":2007.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":204.0,"average_rating":4.24,"ratings_count":23.0,"text_reviews_count":9.0,"description":"SWORDS OF BLOOD AND GLORY!

Technology is rapidly invading fields that it once could not touch, driving cars better than humans do, predicting Supreme Court decisions better than legal experts, packing boxes, identifying faces, scurrying around hospitals delivering medications, all faster, more reliably, less expensively than people. In a world like that, how will we and our children achieve a rising standard of living?\nThe real issue is what we humans are hardwired to do for and with one another, arising from our deepest, most essentially human abilities--empathy, social sensitivity, storytelling, humor, forming relationships, creativity. These are how we create value that all people hunger for, that is unique and not easily quantified.\nIndividuals and companies are already discovering that these high-value abilities create tremendous competitive advantage--more devoted customers, stronger cultures, breakthrough ideas, more effective teams. They're discovering also that while many of us regard these abilities as innate traits--\"he's a real people person,\" \"she's naturally creative\"--it turns out they can all be developed and are being developed in far-sighted organizations from software firms to the U.S. Army to the Cleveland Clinic.

He has covered the game on every continent since the early 1970s. THE COURTS OF BABYLON is more than a collection of essays, most of them growing out of a deep familiarity and, often, relationship with subjects that include Bjorn Borg, Chris Evert, John McEnroe, Evonne Goolangong, Jimmy Connors, Tracy Austin, van Lendl and Martina Navratilova. It is also a commentary on what was lost and what was gained by the transition to professionalism, and how the new, \"Open\" era delivered or failed to make good on the promise that professionalism would make tennis a more inclusive, egalitarian, accessible game.\nRelying heavily on formal, in-depth interviews conducted over two decades and his status as an \"insider\" in an insular game, Bodo's book is both a meditation and expose, a polemic and a tribute to the players who dragged tennis, often kicking and screaming, to the forefront of the public's imagination even when those players got it all too fast and too young.\nBodo delves into the darkest and most controversial areas of the game, chronicling the follies of overzealous parents and pampered athletes. He fearlessly wades into sensitive issues stemming from sex and gender, politics and commercialism. He celebrates the game while holding it to task, all the while acknowledging the reality of the demands and distortions that come with a way of life that is both difficult but glamorous, and eagerly embraced by athletes who, in some cases, are no older than fourteen.\n\"","title_az":"Slim to None","rank":3171887.0,"category":"WomensFiction"},{"isbn":"0525954198","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Man Who Wasn't There: Investigations into the Strange New Science of the Self","author_name":"Anil Ananthaswamy","top_genre":"science","publisher":"Dutton","publication_year":2015.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":320.0,"average_rating":3.66,"ratings_count":613.0,"text_reviews_count":111.0,"description":"In the tradition of Oliver Sacks, a tour of the latest neuroscience of schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, ecstatic epilepsy, Cotard's syndrome, out-of-body experiences, and other disorders--revealing the awesome power of the human sense of self from a master of science journalism.\nAnil Ananthaswamy's extensive in-depth interviews venture into the lives of individuals who offer perspectives that will change how you think about who you are. These individuals all lost some part of what we think of as our self, but they then offer remarkable, sometimes heart-wrenching insights into what remains. One man cut off his own leg. Another became one with the universe.\nWe are learning about the self at a level of detail that Descartes (\"I think therefore I am\") could never have imagined. Recent research into Alzheimer's illuminates how memory creates your narrative self by using the same part of your brain for your past as for your future. But wait, those afflicted with Cotard's syndrome think they are alreadydead; in a way, they believe that \"I think therefore I am not.\" Who--or what--can say that? Neuroscience has identified specific regions of the brain that, when they misfire, can cause the self to move back and forth between the body and a doppelganger, or to leave the body entirely. So where in the brain, or mind, or body, is the self actually located? As Ananthaswamy elegantly reports, neuroscientists themselves now see that the elusive sense of self is both everywhere and nowhere in the human brain.","title_az":"The Man Who Wasn't There: Investigations into the Strange New Science of the Self","rank":377239.0,"category":"Medicine"},{"isbn":"1613777116","asin":null,"title_gr":"Star Trek: The Stardate Collection Volume 1","author_name":"Scott Tipton","top_genre":"star-trek","publisher":"IDW Publishing","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":316.0,"average_rating":4.1,"ratings_count":21.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":"The comic book tales of Star Trek have roamed the universe and spanned publishers, but now Star Trek: The Stardate Collection collects the many iterations of Trek in order... by stardate!

Each chapter offers a spiritual practice that is particularly suited to nurturing us in ways we would never have recognized in our younger lives. For example, the practice of \"listening\" helps us quit superimposing our own take on every situation before we have a chance to hear and see what is truly there; the practice of \"delighting\" encourages us to notice and be thankful for what is small and seemingly insignificant. Each of the 10 practices serves as an antidote to the classic afflictions of old age, such as close-mindedness, complaining, and fear of change.\nA Season of Mysteryis not intended to be a selection of self-improvement secrets; the goal of Huston's work is to encourage people in the second half of life to become \"ordinary mystics\" who are no longer bound by the world's false ideas on aging but instead be freed by God's grace to embrace the riches that come only with growing older.","title_az":"A Season of Mystery: 10 Spiritual Practices for Embracing a Happier Second Half of Life","rank":215178.0,"category":"Catholicism"},{"isbn":"0829437398","asin":null,"title_gr":"What's So Funny About Faith: A Memoir from the Intersection of Hilarious and Holy","author_name":"Jacob D.

And so that night, Weber recounts, he did a little more sinning than usual--just to be certain he wouldn't receive the stigmata!\nIn Fearing the Stigmata, twenty-something Matt Weber--a Harvard graduate, television producer, and certified rosary-bead carrier--employs his sharp wit, earnest candor, and gift for great storytelling to illustrate for young adult Catholics both the real challenges and the immense joys of publicly living out the Catholic faith.

Blumenthal uses the conjunction to unify this collection and create a chanting, sonorous rhythm to his work. The result is a book of poems-as-hymns-and-praises.\nMichael Blumenthalholds the Mina Hohenberg Darden Endowed Chair in Creative Writing at Old Dominion University. His other books include the memoir All My Mothers and Fathers(HarperCollins Publishers, 2002), and the poetry collection Dusty Angel(BOA Editions, Ltd., 1999), for which he was awarded the Isabella Gardner Poetry Award.\nBlumenthal's new collection of poems, titled \"And,\" is the closest that the stoicism of Ecclesiastes will come to getting a 21st-century makeover. In it, there's a time to laugh and cry, scatter stones and gather them up, and all the rest. There's no point, though, in toil and hope beyond that.

Shenoute's letters, sermons, and treatises--one of the most detailed bodies of writing to survive from any early monastery--provide an unparalleled resource for the study of early Christian monasticism and asceticism.\nIn Monastic Bodies, Caroline Schroeder offers an in-depth examination of the asceticism practiced at the White Monastery using diverse sources, including monastic rules, theological treatises, sermons, and material culture. Schroeder details Shenoute's arduous disciplinary code and philosophical structure, including the belief that individual sin corrupted not only the individual body but the entire \"corporate body\" of the community. Thus the purity of the community ultimately depended upon the integrity of each individual monk.\nShenoute's ascetic discourse focused on purity of the body, but he categorized as impure not only activities such as sex but any disobedience and other more general transgressions. Shenoute emphasized the important practices of discipline, or askesis, in achieving this purity. Contextualizing Shenoute within the wider debates about asceticism, sexuality, and heresy that characterized late antiquity, Schroeder compares his views on bodily discipline, monastic punishments, the resurrection of the body, the incarnation of Christ, and monastic authority with those of figures such as Cyril of Alexandria, Paulinus of Nola, and Pachomius.","title_az":"Monastic Bodies: Discipline and Salvation in Shenoute of Atripe (Divinations: Rereading Late Ancient Religion)","rank":4568836.0,"category":"World"},{"isbn":"0826412122","asin":null,"title_gr":"Silent Dwellers: Embracing the Solitary Life","author_name":"Barbara Erakko Taylor","top_genre":"silence","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","publication_year":1999.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":112.0,"average_rating":4.2,"ratings_count":14.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":"The inspiration for this book comes from its author's wanting a modern-day vision for solitude.

When Corbin Jones is convicted of murder and faces years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, though, their love is put to the test.

In Fatal Politics, Hughes turns to the final years of the war and Nixon's reelection bid of 1972 to expose the president's darkest secret.\nWhile Nixon publicly promised to keep American troops in Vietnam only until the South Vietnamese could take their place, he privately agreed with his top military, diplomatic, and intelligence advisers that Saigon could never survive without American boots on the ground. Afraid that a preelection fall of Saigon would scuttle his chances for a second term, Nixon put his reelection above the lives of American soldiers. Postponing the inevitable, he kept America in the war into the fourth year of his presidency. At the same time, Nixon negotiated a \"decent interval\" deal with the Communists to put a face-saving year or two between his final withdrawal and Saigon's collapse. If they waited that long, Nixon secretly assured North Vietnam's chief sponsors in Moscow and Beijing, the North could conquer the South without any fear that the United States would intervene to save it. The humiliating defeat that haunts Americans to this day was built into Nixon's exit strategy. Worse, the myth that Nixon was winning the war before Congress \"tied his hands\" has led policy makers to adapt tactics from America's final years in Vietnam to the twenty-first-century conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, prolonging both wars without winning either.\nForty years after the fall of Saigon, and drawing on more than a decade spent studying Nixon's secretly recorded Oval Office tapes--the most comprehensive, accurate, and illuminating record of any presidency in history, much of it never transcribed until now-- Fatal Politicstells a story of political manipulation and betrayal that will change how Americans remember Vietnam.

To cite just a few examples.\nForgery and Counterforgeryis the first comprehensive study of early Christian pseudepigrapha ever produced in English. In it, Ehrman argues that ancient critics--pagan, Jewish, and Christian--understood false authorial claims to be a form of literary deceit, and thus forgeries. Ehrman considers the extent of the phenomenon, the \"intention\" and motivations of ancient Greek, Roman, and Jewish forgers, and reactions to their work once detected. He also assesses the criteria ancient critics applied to expose forgeries and the techniques forgers used to avoid detection. With the wider practices of the ancient world as backdrop, Ehrman then focuses on early Christian polemics, as various Christian authors forged documents in order to lend their ideas a veneer of authority in literary battles waged with pagans, Jews, and, most importantly, with one another in internecine disputes over doctrine and practice. In some instances a forger directed his work against views found in another forgery, creating thereby a \"counter-forgery.\" Ehrman's evaluation of polemical forgeries starts with those of the New Testament (nearly half of whose books make a false authorial claim) up through the Pseudo-Ignatian epistles and the Apostolic Constitutions at the end of the fourth century.\nShining light on an important but overlooked feature of the early Christian world, Forgery and Counterforgeryexplores the possible motivations of the deceivers who produced these writings, situating their practice within ancient Christian discourses on lying and deceit.","title_az":"Forgery and Counterforgery: The Use of Literary Deceit in Early Christian Polemics","rank":1347219.0,"category":"World"},{"isbn":"1523886099","asin":null,"title_gr":"Jockblocked (Gridiron, #2)","author_name":"Jen Frederick","top_genre":"new-adult","publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publication_year":2016.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":416.0,"average_rating":4.05,"ratings_count":15.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"She's always played it safe...

It was one misery upon another. He lived in sand for six months, his girlfriend back home betrayed him for a scrawny hotel clerk, he was punished by boredom and fear, he considered suicide, he pulled a gun on one of his fellow marines, and he was shot at by both Iraqis and Americans. At the end of the war, Swofford hiked for miles through a landscape of incinerated Iraqi soldiers and later was nearly killed in a booby-trapped Iraqi bunker.\nSwofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp (which included physical abuse by his drill instructor), reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man.\nUnlike the real-time print and television coverage of the Gulf War, which was highly scripted by the Pentagon, Swofford's account subverts the conventional wisdom that U.S. military interventions are now merely surgical insertions of superior forces that result in few American casualties. \"Jarhead\" insists we remember the Americans who are in fact wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life.\nA harrowing yet inspiring portrait of atormented consciousness struggling for inner peace, \"Jarhead\" will elbow for room on that short shelf of American war classics that includes Philip Caputo's \"A Rumor of War\" and Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried,\" and be admired not only for the raw beauty of its prose but also for the depth of its pained heart.","title_az":"Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles","rank":1087116.0,"category":"Military"},{"isbn":"0099448599","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Dumas Club","author_name":"Arturo Perez-Reverte","top_genre":"mystery","publisher":"Vintage","publication_year":2003.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":323.0,"average_rating":3.82,"ratings_count":155.0,"text_reviews_count":16.0,"description":"A well-know bibliophile is found hanged days after selling a rare manuscript of Alexander Dumas's classic, The Three Musketeers.

It is Mike Myers' funny and thoughtful analysis of what makes Canada Canada, Canadians Canadians and what being Canadian has always meant to him. His relationship with his home and native land continues to deepen and grow, he says. In fact, American friends have actually accused him of \"enjoying\" being Canadian and he's happy to plead guilty as charged.\nA true patriot who happens to be an expatriate, Myers is in a unique position to explore Canada from within and without. With this, his first book, Mike brings his love for Canada to the fore at a time when the country is once again looking ahead with hope and national pride. \"Canada\" is a wholly subjective account of Mike's Canadian experience.

Having reached the six-month anniversary of his lover's death, he embarks on a journey of remembrance that will recount his struggle to become a writer and his discovery of what it means to be a gay man. His witty, conversational narrative transports us from the 1960s to the near present, from starkly erotic scenes in the back rooms of New York clubs to episodes of rarefied hilarity in the salons of Paris to moments of family truth in the American Midwest. Along the way, a breathtaking variety of personal connections--and near misses--slowly builds an awareness of the transformative power of genuine friendship, of love and loss, culminating in an indelible experience with a dying man. And as the flow of memory carries us across time, space and society, one man's magnificently realized story grows to encompass an entire generation.\nSublimely funny yet elegiac, full of unsparingly trenchant social observation yet infused with wisdom and a deeply felt compassion, The Farewell Symphonyis a triumph of reflection and expressive elegance.

Twenty-five years later, she sharpens her pen for her most controversial work yet -- the biography of her old friend, the radical and feminist Fanny Wright. She recalls the 1820s when the young Fanny erupted into the Trollopes' sleepy English cottage like a volcano, her red hair flying, her talk aflame with utopian ideals. Before long, Wright has convinced Frances to follow her to America, a journey of extreme penury, frontier hardships, and the most satisfying sensual romance of Frances Trollope's life.\nThe biography soon degenerates into a settling of scores and digressions on the misadventures of Mrs. Trollope's own family. By turns noble and petty, comic and tragic, it introduces us to literary lions, battling political theorists, gamblers and escaped slaves, and even the aging General Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson. With hallucinatory realism, Mrs. Trollope paints French chateaux, Belgian fogs, Mississippi mud, and the gaudy splendors and cruelties of Haiti. And throughout this sparkling narrative, we find love in all its forms -- in the family, between races and generations, and within the same sex.\nFanny: A Fiction is a wonderful new departure for Edmund White -- a quirky, dazzling story of two extraordinary nineteenth-century women, and a vibrant, questioning exploration of the nature of idealism, the clay feet of heroes, and the illusory power of the American dream.","title_az":"Fanny: A Fiction","rank":1080331.0,"category":"GenreFiction"},{"isbn":"0307346153","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Reluctant Queen: The Story of Anne of York (Queens of England, #8)","author_name":"Jean Plaidy","top_genre":"historical-fiction","publisher":"Three Rivers Press (CA)","publication_year":2007.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":450.0,"average_rating":3.83,"ratings_count":1199.0,"text_reviews_count":55.0,"description":"In 1470, a reluctant Lady Anne Neville is betrothed by her father, the politically ambitious Earl of Warwick, to Edward, Prince of Wales.

This sliver of land located between the rivers was evolving from a bustling seaport into a world financial center. Manhattan rapidly became America's preeminent East Coast steamship port. Steamers were becoming a frequent and luxurious mode of transportation. They arrived in Manhattan carrying passengers from all walks of life--the very rich and the very poor. Wealthy travelers made their voyages on the palatial reaches of the upper decks and were the catalyst that spawned the gilded era of Manhattan's hotels. Working-class passengers, on the other hand, traveled deep below decks. From the damp, dark reaches of the steamers poured a flood of immigrant labor and talent that enriched the area's industries. In the 1880s, no building stood as tall as the spire of architect Richard Upjohn's Trinity Church. Along the city streetscape, trolleys were pulled by horses, and steam-powered, elevated trains sliced north from the battery to upper Manhattan. The 1890s began the defining decades of the skyscraper. The technology originated in Chicago but soared to new heights in Manhattan. By the turn of the century, there were more skyscrapers on the island than anywhere else in the world.","title_az":"Between the Rivers: Manhattan 1880-1920 (Images of America)","rank":1979652.0,"category":"Americas"},{"isbn":"0262550350","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Aesthetics of the Japanese Lunchbox","author_name":"Kenji Ekuan","top_genre":"japan","publisher":"Mit Press","publication_year":2000.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":208.0,"average_rating":4.0,"ratings_count":12.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"The Makunouchi Bento, or traditional Japanese lunchbox, is a highly lacquered wooden box divided into quadrants, each of which contains different delicacies. It is also one of the most familiar images of Japan's domestic environment. When presented to the diner, the Japanese lunchbox seems straightforward enough; each of four food portions resides in its own compartment, apparently obeying a strict lunchbox geometry. So far, just food. But Kenji Ekuan reveals that a much deeper reading is possible, one that sees the lunchbox as nothing less than a key to an understanding of Japanese civilization, the spirit of form, and the aesthetic ideal in which the many are reduced to one.Ekuan reads the Japanese lunchbox as both object and metaphor. It is one of this book's many charms that he is able to see it as both simultaneously. He compares the visual pleasures of the Zen lunchbox to an aerial view of the Japanese archipelago; he invites us to savor its quadripartite structure as we savor the four seasons. In so doing, he unlocks the secrets of ancient Japanese rituals, celebrates the aesthetics of Japanese design, explores the contours of Japanese landscapes and technology, and delineates the forty-eight rules of the etiquette of Japanese form.With an agility more characteristic of poetry than of design criticism, he connects everything from food, television, motorcycles, package tours, and department stores to landscape, ecology, computers, and radios, all the while keeping his eye on his subject. In this book of magical transformations, nothing is what it first appears, but everything is deepened by \"lunchbox theory.\" Consider the influence of the lunchbox on TV viewing, for example: chopsticks are used to stroll through a meal, just as remote control devices are used to browse TV channels.

They ring the bell, though no one is expecting them. They don't speak English. They've arrived from Russia with only $700 and the conviction that this six-year-old will be the next tennis star. Surprisingly, they are right.\nYoung Maria Sharapova went on to become one of the best, most famous, and highest-paid athletes. At seventeen, she won Wimbledon. At eighteen, she was ranked number one. To date, she has won five Grand Slams. Her stardom spills off the court to fashion, philanthropy, food. But at the peak of her popularity, Sharapova faced a new challenge, after testing positive for a banned drug. The backlash was shocking--sponsors fled, fans berated her, and she received a two-year suspension. Despite successfully appealing her sentence, she still faced the battle of maintaining her eminence on the court and her place in fans' hearts.

He is determined to prove--to the subway bosses who have recently fired him, to his badgering, pregnant wife--\"that the hours of his life belong to himself alone.\" In the aftermath of the fire that follows, Sister St. Savior, an aging nun, appears, unbidden, to direct the way forward for his widow and his unborn child.\nWe begin deep inside Catholic Brooklyn, in the early part of the twentieth century. Decorum, superstition, and shame collude to erase the man's brief existence. Yet his suicide, although never spoken of, reverberates through many lives and over the decades--testing the limits and the demands of love and sacrifice, of forgiveness and forgetfulness, even through multiple generations.\nThe characters we meet, from Sally, the unborn baby at the beginning of the novel, who becomes the center of the story, to the nuns whose personalities we come to know and love, to the neighborhood families with whose lives they are entwined, are all rendered with extraordinary sympathy and McDermott's trademark lucidity and intelligence.\nAlice McDermott's The Ninth Houris a crowning achievement by one of the premiere writers at work in America today.","title_az":"The Ninth Hour: A Novel","rank":49578.0,"category":"GenreFiction"},{"isbn":"1846860830","asin":null,"title_gr":"Indian Tales","author_name":"Shenaaz Nanji","top_genre":"kids","publisher":"Barefoot Books","publication_year":2007.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":96.0,"average_rating":4.15,"ratings_count":36.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"The stories you will find here come from all over the Indian subcontinent.

The constant shifting of their bodies through unfamiliar dimensions together with the\nfrightfully cold and poisonous atmosphere they breathe and their implacable emotional detachment make the Palainians one of the more unsettling races known to Civilization. But, as events will soon demonstrate, they are also one of its most valuable assets.\nIn the process of training a new class of Z-type Lensmen cadets from the Palainian Z-Academy, Nadreck makes the unintentionally fateful decision to bring a religious leader from a Boskonian Spawn-influenced planet to be studied on Tellus before continuing on to Palain VII. On Tellus, Nadreck and the newly-promoted Galactic Patrol lieutenant Benson Cloudd become aware of a strange new problem affecting Civilized space. Machines throughout a wide swathe of the galaxy have begun to malfunction, and communicators, spaceships and computers are becoming increasingly unreliable. But in the process of searching for the source of this mechanical mayhem, Nadreck discovers something even more disturbing: remnants of\nthe Eddorian Conspiracy are planning a new invasion, and their forces are gathering on multiple planes of existence!\nFaced with mysteries and threats on multiple fronts, Nadreck, Cloudd and the android-bodied Lensman Lalla Kallatra must work together while at the same time scattering themselves across\nthe stars, each in pursuit of their own piece of the puzzle.

The best authors put painstaking--sometimes obsessive--effort into each element of their stories, from plot and character development to dialogue and point of view.\nWhat made Nabokov choose the name Lolita? Why did Fitzgerald use first-person narration in The Great Gatsby? How did Kerouac, who raged against revision, finally come to revise On the Road? Veteran editor and teacher Richard Cohen draws on his vast reservoir of a lifetime's reading and his insight into what makes good prose soar. Here are Gabriel Garcia Marquez's thoughts on how to start a novel (\"In the first paragraph you solve most of the problems with your book\"); Virginia Woolf offering her definition of style (\"It is all rhythm. Once you get that, you can't use the wrong words\"); and Vladimir Nabokov on the nature of fiction (\"All great novels are great fairy tales\").\nCohen has researched the published works and private utterances of our greatest authors to discover the elements that made their prose memorable. The result is a unique exploration of the act and art of writing that enriches our experience of reading both the classics and the best modern fiction. Evoking the marvelous, the famous, and the irreverent, he reveals the challenges that even the greatest writers faced--and shows us how they surmounted them.\nAdvance praise for How to Write Like Tolstoy\n\"This book is a wry, critical friend to both writer and reader.

It was the body alone that was left, even as she went beyond the body.'\nJourneys form the leitmotif of these astonishing new stories by Ambai. Sometimes culminating in an unconventional love affair, some are extraordinary tales of loyalty and integrity; others touch on the almost fantastic, absurd aspect of Mumbai. Yet others explore the notion of a wholesome self, and its tragic absence at times. These stories are illuminated by vivid and unusual characters: from an eccentric, penurious singer-couple who adopt an ape as their son, to a male prostitute, who is battered by bimbos for not giving 'full' satisfaction.\nCrucially, some of the stories, like the title one, engage uninhibitedly with a woman's relationship to her body. For Ambai, feminist par excellence, the sensual body, experienced as a natural landscape changing with age, is at the same time, the only vehicle of life and tool for mapping the external world.","title_az":"Fish in a Dwindling Lake","rank":5838991.0,"category":null},{"isbn":"0768426510","asin":null,"title_gr":"Saved by Angels: To Share How God Talks to Everyday People","author_name":"Bruce Van Natta","top_genre":"amazon_kindle","publisher":"Destiny Image Incorporated","publication_year":2008.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":233.0,"average_rating":4.03,"ratings_count":21.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"\"To share how God talks to everyday people\"--Cover.","title_az":"Saved by Angels: to share how GOD talks to everyday people","rank":1710735.0,"category":"ChristianLiving"},{"isbn":"1569802858","asin":null,"title_gr":"What Goes Up...: Surviving the Manic Episode of a Loved One","author_name":"Judy Eron","top_genre":"psychology","publisher":"Barricade Books","publication_year":2005.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":212.0,"average_rating":3.61,"ratings_count":28.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"For those with loved ones who suffer from manic-depression.","title_az":"What Goes Up: Surviving the Manic Episode of a Loved One","rank":1757365.0,"category":"MentalHealth"},{"isbn":"0990995232","asin":null,"title_gr":"Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Sword Princess (The Great Detective in Love #1)","author_name":"Suzette Hollingsworth","top_genre":"mystery","publisher":null,"publication_year":2015.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":226.0,"average_rating":3.84,"ratings_count":30.0,"text_reviews_count":12.0,"description":"Mirabella Hudson soon learns that the Great Detective has more in store for her than washing jars and labeling specimens: pistol shooting, fencing, boxing, and Jiu-Jitsu.

The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?\nIn The Body Project, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance--in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy.

Murphy follows each would-be assassin and the repercussions of their actions, illuminating daily life in Victorian England, the development of the monarchy under Queen Victoria and the evolution of the attacks in light of evolving social issues and technology.\nThere was Edward Oxford, a bartender who dreamed of becoming an admiral, who was simply shocked when his attempt to shoot the pregnant Queen and Prince consort made him a madman in the world's eyes. There was hunchbacked John Bean, who dreamed of historical notoriety in a publicized treason trial, and William Hamilton, forever scarred by the ravages of the Irish Potato Famine. Roderick MacLean enabled Victoria to successfully strike insanity pleas from Britain's legal process. Most threatening of all were the \"dynamitards\" who targeted her Majesty's Golden Jubilee--who signaled the advent of modern terrorism with their publicly focused attack.\nFrom these cloak-and-dagger plots to Victoria's brilliant wit and steadfast courage, Shooting Victoriais historical narrative at its most thrilling, complete with astute insight into how these attacks actually revitalized the British crown at a time when monarchy was quickly becoming unpopular abroad. While thrones across Europe toppled, the Queen's would-be assassins contributed greatly to the preservation of the monarchy and to the stability that it enjoys today.

Our perspectives narrowed by hindsight, the world of that year is reduced to its most frivolous features--last summers in grand aristocratic residences--or its most destructive ones: the unresolved rivalries of the great European powers, the fear of revolution, violence in the Balkans.\nIn this illuminating history, Charles Emmerson liberates the world of 1913 from this \"prelude to war\" narrative, and explores it as it was, in all its richness and complexity. Traveling from Europe's capitals, then at the height of their global reach, to the emerging metropolises of Canada and the United States, the imperial cities of Asia and Africa, and the boomtowns of Australia and South America, he provides a panoramic view of a world crackling with possibilities, its future still undecided, its outlook still open.\nThe world in 1913 was more modern than we remember, more similar to our own times than we expect, more globalized than ever before. The Gold Standard underpinned global flows of goods and money, while mass migration reshaped the world's human geography. Steamships and sub-sea cables encircled the earth, along with new technologies and new ideas. Ford's first assembly line cranked to life in 1913 in Detroit.

Ben Shepherd draws on a wealth of primary sources and recent scholarship to convey a much darker, more complex picture. For the first time, the German army is examined throughout the Second World War, across all combat theaters and occupied regions, and from multiple perspectives: its battle performance, social composition, relationship with the Nazi state, and involvement in war crimes and military occupation.\nThis was a true people's army, drawn from across German society and reflecting that society as it existed under the Nazis. Without the army and its conquests abroad, Shepherd explains, the Nazi regime could not have perpetrated its crimes against Jews, prisoners of war, and civilians in occupied countries. The author examines how the army was complicit in these crimes and why some soldiers, units, and higher commands were more complicit than others. Shepherd also reveals the reasons for the army's early battlefield successes and its mounting defeats up to 1945, the latter due not only to Allied superiority and Hitler's mismanagement as commander-in-chief, but also to the failings--moral, political, economic, strategic, and operational--of the army's own leadership.","title_az":"Hitler's Soldiers: The German Army in the Third Reich","rank":286979.0,"category":"Europe"},{"isbn":"161264158X","asin":null,"title_gr":"Tangle of Fates","author_name":"Leslie Ann Moore","top_genre":"science-fiction","publisher":"Muse Harbor Publishing","publication_year":2014.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":472.0,"average_rating":4.36,"ratings_count":17.0,"text_reviews_count":9.0,"description":"What if Snow White had been a revolutionary... instead of a pawn?\nNuetierra.

Such a book, we submit, is Old Yeller; to read this eloquently simple story of a boy and his dog in the Texas hill country is an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.\nThe big, ugly, yellow dog showed up out of nowhere one night and stole a whole side of hanging pork, and when Travis went for him the next morning that dog started yelling like a baby before he was touched. Then he got into the spring water with five-year-old Arliss, Travis took an easy hate to Old Yeller, as they started to call him; in fact, he would have driven him off or killed him if it hadn't been for brother Arliss' loud and violent protests, So Yeller stayed, and Travis soon found he couldn't have got along without him.\nPa and Ma and Travis and Arliss lived on Birdsong Creek in the Texas hill country. It wasn't an easy life, but they had a snug cabin that Pa had built himself, and they had their own hogs and their own cattle, and they grew most of what else they needed. The only thing they and the rest of the settlers lacked that year in the late 1860's was cash, so the men decided to get together and drive all the cattle up to the new market in Abilene, Kansas, more than six hundred miles away.\nTravis was only fourteen, but he was proud of his new role as man of the family and determined to live up to his responsibility. It was hard work, too, plowing until his legs ached, chopping wood until his hands were raw and his head was spinning, weeding the garden in the hot sun, toting the heavy buckets tip from the spring, and trying to keep his mischievous little brother in line.\nBut there were pleasant moments, too: his Ma treating him like a man, and deer hunting in the early-morning stillness, and hot summer nights out in the corn patch under the stars with Old Yeller, trying to keep the coons and skunks out of the winter food supply. And there was plenty of excitement, like the fight between the two bulls, and the time Arliss nearly got mauled by the bear, and trying to catch and mark the new hogs. Here the suspense and excitement reach a peak, only to be topped a few pages later when the crazy-sick loafer wolf goes for Ma. Both times it is Yeller who saves them, only the second time it is not lucky for Yeller, as Travis comes to find out. And in finding out, Travis learns just how much he has come to love that big ugly dog, and he learns something about the pain of life, too.\nOld Yeller is a story that will be read and treasured by many thousands for years to come. In a shorter form, this has appeared as a three-part serial in Collier's.","title_az":"Old Yeller","rank":49070.0,"category":"Literature&Fiction"},{"isbn":"0807859354","asin":null,"title_gr":"We Have a Religion: The 1920s Pueblo Indian Dance Controversy and American Religious Freedom","author_name":"Tisa Wenger","top_genre":"academic","publisher":"University of North Carolina Press","publication_year":2009.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":333.0,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":35.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"For Native Americans, religious freedom has been an elusive goal. From nineteenth-century bans on indigenous ceremonial practices to twenty-first-century legal battles over sacred lands, peyote use, and hunting practices, the U.S. government has often acted as if Indian traditions were somehow not truly religious and therefore not eligible for the constitutional protections of the First Amendment. In this book, Tisa Wenger shows that cultural notions about what constitutes \"religion\" are crucial to public debates over religious freedom.\nIn the 1920s, Pueblo Indian leaders in New Mexico and a sympathetic coalition of non-Indian reformers successfully challenged government and missionary attempts to suppress Indian dances by convincing a skeptical public that these ceremonies counted as religion. This struggle for religious freedom forced the Pueblos to employ Euro-American notions of religion, a conceptual shift with complex consequences within Pueblo life. Long after the dance controversy, Wenger demonstrates, dominant concepts of religion and religious freedom have continued to marginalize indigenous traditions within the United States.","title_az":"We Have a Religion: The 1920s Pueblo Indian Dance Controversy and American Religious Freedom","rank":723203.0,"category":"Americas"},{"isbn":"1563522969","asin":null,"title_gr":"Atlanta Rising: The Invention of an International City 1946-1996","author_name":"Frederick Allen","top_genre":"historical","publisher":"Taylor Trade Publishing","publication_year":1996.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":290.0,"average_rating":4.05,"ratings_count":38.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":"Former CNN commentator Frederick Allen presents a behind-the-scenes look at the men who transformed Atlanta from a sleepy Southern backwater to an international powerhouse--and how they did it.

But as an adult, she found herself in poor health, and, having tried cures of every kind, a doctor finally ordered her to eat meat. Warily, she ventured into the butcher shop, and as the man behind the counter wrapped up her first-ever chicken, she found herself charmed. Eventually, he dared her to cook her way through his meat counter. As Tara navigates through this new world--grass-fed beef vs. grain-fed beef; finding chickens that are truly free-range-- she's tempted to give up and go back to eating tempeh. The more she learns about meat and how it's produced, and the effects eating it has on the human body and the planet, the less she feels she knows. She embarks upon a sometimes hilarious, sometimes frightening whirlwind tour that takes her from slaughterhouse to chef's table, from urban farm to the hearthside of cow wranglers. Along the way, she meets an unforgettable cast of characters who all seem to take a vested interest in whether she opts for turnips or T-bones. The Butcher and the Vegetarian is the rollicking and relevant story of one woman's quest to reconcile a nontraditional upbringing with carnal desires.","title_az":"The Butcher and the Vegetarian: One Woman's Romp Through a World of Men, Meat, and Moral Crisis","rank":2274285.0,"category":"Professionals&amp;Academics"},{"isbn":"0926888013","asin":null,"title_gr":"THE Complete Keys to Progress","author_name":"John  McCallum","top_genre":"training","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.93,"ratings_count":61.0,"text_reviews_count":11.0,"description":null,"title_az":"THE Complete Keys to Progress","rank":573926.0,"category":"Exercise&Fitness"},{"isbn":"1594740534","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Handbook of Style: Expert Fashion and Beauty Advice","author_name":"Sarah Woodruff","top_genre":"fashion","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.5,"ratings_count":30.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":"Expert Advice for Improving Your Look\nThe Handbook of Style is packed with fashion and beauty techniques every woman should know--straight from today's top hair stylists, skin specialists, fashion designers, and makeup artists.

He wrote the first American translation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and was one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets. He established his literary career by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines. Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825, he had published nearly 40 minor poems. About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette. After graduating in 1825, he was offered a job as professor of modern languages at his alma mater. The story, possibly apocryphal, is that an influential trustee, Benjamin Orr, had been so impressed by Longfellow's translation of Horace that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French, Spanish and Italian.

At the command of the Lord of the Isles, Muirteach and his wife Mariota accompany Donald, the lord's surly thirteen-year-old son, to Oxford where Donald is to enroll in university. Shortly after their arrival a winsome tavern maid disappears. At his charge's insistence, Muirteach attempts to help Undersheriff Grymbaud with the investigation, as well as keep Donald at his studies and out of the taverns. He has little success with either venture, although the discovery of some bizarre and suggestive drawings on old parchments piques the curiosity of Donald and his peers. Meanwhile, Mariota thirsts to attend medical lectures at the schools, which are closed to women, and seeks a way to gain admittance to them. When an Oxford master is found brutally bludgeoned to death, Grymbaud asks Muirteach to investigate the slaying. The eventual arrest of an aged servant at the college stirs the ever-simmering discord between townsfolk and university students. The unrest culminates in riots and another senseless killing occurs, endangering Mariota.

Ken Griffin of Citadel started out trading convertible bonds from his dorm room at Harvard. Julian Robertson staffed his hedge fund with college athletes half his age, then he flew them to various retreats in the Rockies and raced them up the mountains. Paul Tudor Jones posed for a magazine photograph next to a killer shark and happily declared that a 1929- style crash would be \"total rock-and-roll\" for him. Michael Steinhardt was capable of reducing underlings to sobs. \"All I want to do is kill myself,\" one said. \"Can I watch?\" Steinhardt responded.\nFinance professors have long argued that beating the market is impossible, and yet drawing on insights from physics, economics, and psychology, these titans have cracked the market's mysteries and gone on to earn fortunes. Their innovation has transformed the world, spawning new markets in exotic financial instruments and rewriting the rules of capitalism.\nMore than just a history, More Money Than Godis a window on tomorrow's financial system. Hedge funds have been left for dead after past financial panics: After the stock market rout of the early 1970s, after the bond market bloodbath of 1994, after the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, and yet again after the dot-com crash in 2000. Each time, hedge funds have proved to be survivors, and it would be wrong to bet against them now. Banks such as CitiGroup, brokers such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, home lenders such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, insurers such as AIG, and money market funds run by giants such as Fidelity-all have failed or been bailed out.

He often said it was from them that he got his love of sculpture. It certainly didn't come from his own father, a respectable magistrate who beat his son when he asked to become an artists apprentice.\nBut Michelangelo persevered. His early sculptures caught the attention of Florence's great ruler, Lorenzo de' Medici, who invited the boy to be educated with his own sons. Soon after, Michelangelo was astonishing people with the lifelike creations he wrested from marble--from the heartbreaking Pieta he sculpted when he was only twenty-five to the majestic David that brought him acclaim as the greatest sculptor in Italy.\nMichelangelo had a turbulent, quarrelsome life. He was obsessed with perfection and felt that everyone--from family members to his demanding patrons--took advantage and let him down. His long and difficult association with Pope Julius II yielded his greatest masterpiece, the radiant paintings in the Sistine Chapel, and his most disastrous undertaking, the monumental tomb that caused the artist frustration and heartache for forty years.\nWith her thoroughly researched, lively narrative and superbly detailed illustrations, Diane Stanley has captured the life of an artist who towered above the late Renaissance--and whose brilliance in architecture, painting, and sculpture amazes and moves us to this day.\nChildren's Books 2000-NY Public Lib., Books for Youth Editor's Choice 2000 (Booklist), Lasting Connections 2000 (Book Links), Best Books 2000 (School Library Journal), Top 10 Youth Art Books 2000 (Booklist), and Notable Children's Trade Books in the Field of Social Studies 2001, National Council for SS & Child.

He looks at the central place of prayer in the Rule of St Benedict and the tradition of continuous prayer, exploring the teaching of such formative figures as Basil the Great. He then reflects on the Benedictine precept: 'nothing is to be preferred to the work of God'.\nPraying with Benedictlooks in practical terms at the how, when, and where of prayer; at bodily postures, various types of prayer, and the importance of emotional and spiritual readiness. Finally, the place of the Eucharist in the life of prayer is discussed with reference to Benedict's teaching and the Eucharistic practices of pre-Benedictine monasticism.\nThis book offers a clear presentation of monastic spirituality and opens it to persons outside monastery walls. It links St Benedict's teaching to earlier spiritual traditions and shows how various elements of monastic life complement each other. Common prayer, reading, personal prayer, and the Eucharist are not isolated from one another or from daily life, but are integral and essential elements of living in the spirit of St Benedict.","title_az":"Praying With Benedict: Prayer in the Rule of St. Benedict (Cistercian Studies)","rank":2638888.0,"category":"Churches&ChurchLeadership"},{"isbn":"1405288655","asin":null,"title_gr":"Friendliest Friends: The Great Cat-Nap","author_name":"SACCONEJOLYs","top_genre":"picture-book","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.21,"ratings_count":19.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":null,"title_az":"The SACCONEJOLYs and the Great Cat-Nap","rank":867997.0,"category":null},{"isbn":"1469973391","asin":null,"title_gr":"Dewinter #1: Creatures of the Damned","author_name":"Misty Harvey","top_genre":"e-books","publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":366.0,"average_rating":4.56,"ratings_count":3.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"The Beast...a terrible secret, impossible to control, and always thirsting for blood.

Brazen and formidable in designer T-shirts and motorcycle boots, he seems unflappable whether he's making his rounds through the decadent decor of the Tunnel, or whipping through the desert heat on his bike. But inside he is a shattered man, desperate to understand what unconditional love from a woman feels like.\nHiding the effects of his emotionally stunted youth behind a gritty persona, and keeping his fractured soul buried deep while seeking out his baser instincts, Asher is convinced he is man enough to leave the past in the past. The only clue to his broken soul is his deep-seated need to provide safety and a good life for emotionally damaged women within the glamorous walls of his strip club.\nFooling himself that he deserves little in life, Asher keeps his big heart tightly guarded with everyone but Sienna Flower, his friend, business partner, and headliner. Until, that is, the night he runs into his childhood friend, Natalie Parker. While trolling a rival strip club, perusing their offerings for his own personal pleasure, he collides with his past. Coming face-to-face with a woman he only knew as a girl, he's shaken when he finds the dark-haired beauty in a precarious position. Now all grown up, she's a hardened soul who reminds him of where he came from, and stirs within him the need to protect yet another woman.\nKnown as Nat to most everyone, Natalie is a single mom to Quinn. But when she's under the bright spotlights in a thong, she's known as Natasha or Nataleigh Dallas. A girl who once had everything going for her, she's now a jaded stripper with only room for her son in her life, and has erected impenetrable barriers around her heart. The strength of those walls is challenged the night a man she has known since childhood steamrolls his way back into her life, flashing those smoky-gray eyes that have always melted her.\nA man she has loved from afar since she was a young girl, one who lights fire to her walls, burning deeper, setting everything ablaze--smoldering her.\nAsher and Natalie, two people who are equally tormented by their own demons, set out to rescue each other as part-time lovers in a torrid, desperate workplace affair. Thinking they can remain friends while keeping their hearts at a safe distance, they find themselves at odds when their situation morphs into a messy, tangled mess.\nRipping free of each other proves impossible as they learn that the very web that connects them goes much deeper than they ever expected.","title_az":"Smoldered (The Electric Tunnel) (Volume 2)","rank":5528394.0,"category":"Contemporary"},{"isbn":"2020261995","asin":null,"title_gr":"Le fils du pauvre","author_name":"Mouloud Feraoun","top_genre":"francais","publisher":"Contemporary French Fiction","publication_year":1995.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":160.0,"average_rating":3.9,"ratings_count":371.0,"text_reviews_count":32.0,"description":"Un village de montagne, Kabylie, debut du siecle.

As America's voracious appetite for chicken has grown, so has the industry's reliance on immigrant workers, whose structural position makes them particularly vulnerable to exploitation.\nBased on the author's six years of collaboration with a local workers' center, this book explores how Black, white, and new Latino Mississippians have lived and understood these transformations.

But when Willowmena is kidnapped by a monstrous bird, and Brighton discovers she's been taken to a land called Amaraka, he abandons all other concerns, and swears an oath to get her back. Forced to traverse the dimensions of time and space, and reincarnate in a new body, Brighton is reborn in Kansas shortly after the end of the American Civil War which has been won by the South.

SAVAK's systematic torture of Evin Prison's inmates infuriates and confronts Jamsheed's conscience and security status to the point of underground resistance. Subsequently, he is publicly branded a fugitive of the law, which compels him to forge a fragile, unlikely alliance with outlawed, anti-regime resistance fighters and political organizations, including the communist-leaning Tudeh Party. His one-year asylum under the protection of Tehran's Assyrian Church subjects him to a brief romantic encounter with loyal church member Fareeda, an outspoken, nurse and daring Assyrian freedom fighter. He is also conflicted by his own covert actions, constantly questioning whether they are driven by his instinctive desire to seek justice or revenge, particularly when obsessed by an unrelenting crave to embarrass his former commander Nabizadeh before the shah, he blindly admires, and expose him embroiled in multiple scandals, including blackmail, drug trafficking and child kidnapping. As Jamsheed's world increasingly slips on the fast track of regime change, he and brother Mahmood reluctantly flee Iran before travel restrictions are imposed, as their homeland is poised to welcome its exiled religious leader, the Ayatollah Raola Khomeini, in February of 1979. Whether or not Jamsheed Al-Armaghani returns to Iran is ultimately influenced by Evin's former inmate, Thuraya Al Gailani.","title_az":"The Pahlavi Sword","rank":5806042.0,"category":"MiddleEast"},{"isbn":"1400069416","asin":null,"title_gr":"Lime Creek","author_name":"Joe Henry","top_genre":"fiction","publisher":"Random House","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":160.0,"average_rating":3.33,"ratings_count":118.0,"text_reviews_count":57.0,"description":"In this wonderful work of fiction, Joe Henry explores the complex relationship between a father and his sons, whose deep connections to one another, to the land, and to the creatures that inhabit it give meaning to their lives.\nSpencer Davis, his wife, Elizabeth, and their sons, Luke, Whitney, and Lonny, work with horses and with their hands.

One day, while looking through dusty bookshelves he comes upon a series of black, leather journals. He quickly becomes engrossed in reading her accounts of archaeological excavations: digging at Ramses' tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings in 1995, excavating ancient Indian cities at Harappa in 1986. His attention is drawn to a dozen more journals stretching along the bookcase: Field Notes from the Discovery of Tutankhamen's Tomb, 1922, Finding Troy, 1871, Work with Johannes Burkhardt, 1812. Simon glances toward his mentor who silently watches him take down several books and scan their pages. They are what they appear to be--her personal notes from excavations stretching back nearly 200 years. So begins Simon's introduction to time travel. Professor Ananke is a Master Time Traveler. She agrees to accept Simon as her apprentice, to teach him the secrets of time travel. After a few brief practice trips, Simon feels he is beginning to learn the tricks of this dangerous business. But one day, while photographing a mysterious medieval manuscript, he is grabbed and thrown through time under no control of his own. Simon lands, shaken and confused, in a medieval wood in Yorkshire, England. He is discovered by a young lady, Bryn Berengar, who involves him in a dangerous and suspenseful mystery tied to the murder of Thomas Becket. Their search for the manuscript that provides clues to the mystery exposes them to many dangers, including being poisoned by monk's hood, locked in a tower room with a corpse, and fighting a desperate knight with a secret to hide. They travel to Carlisle Castle to thwart a plot to overthrow King Henry II and Simon finds the fencing lessons he took at the local youth bureau take on great importance as he fights for his life. Perhaps most dangerous however, is the relationship he is developing with Bryn.","title_az":"The Time Traveler's Apprentice","rank":1786331.0,"category":"ScienceFiction&amp;Fantasy"},{"isbn":"0671530747","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Complete Book of Pastry: Sweet & Savory","author_name":"Bernard Clayton Jr.","top_genre":"cookbooks","publisher":"Touchstone","publication_year":1984.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":416.0,"average_rating":4.2,"ratings_count":22.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":"An extensive collection of international pastry recipes, with complete instructions for various appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and drawings to illustrate pastry shapes and techniques.","title_az":"Complete Book of Pastry","rank":1564425.0,"category":"Baking"},{"isbn":"0061214531","asin":null,"title_gr":"Finn's Going","author_name":"Tom Kelly","top_genre":"realistic-fiction","publisher":"Greenwillow Books","publication_year":2007.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":278.0,"average_rating":3.53,"ratings_count":47.0,"text_reviews_count":13.0,"description":"Take Finn.

Having proven his awareness and sensitivity in A Boy Aware, Geoffrey has reached a new level and is ready to share his thoughts once again. Between Two Junes is a Forest is a journal that spans the course of a year--from June to June--offering an outpouring of topics important to everyone, especially today's youth.

As the young voice of today, Geoffrey easily disproves the old stereotype of teenagers as superficial and naive. He exudes maturity as he communicates his own political views with more eloquence than most adults, but at the same time this teenager at heart is a loyal devotee to girls, sports, and music.

Even at our best, fallible creatures that we are, to succeed at staying together for thirty-five years and counting, is truly amazing. But there is something more - one senses the sure hand of God upon the lives of these friends, as He has providentially drawn and held them together. You will be inspired, motivated and blessed, held in the grip of God's love, as you read. Helen Kooiman Hosier Author, Biographer, Compiler, Editor People ask \"How can a group of twenty women stay together for thirty-five years?\" It is all the more amazing when people learn that these women come from a background of ten different denominations, attend twelve different churches, live in ten different cities and are from different cultural and educational backgrounds. These women, who call themselves the SPURS, chose their name from Hebrews 10:24: And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together. They have met and spurred each other on for thirty-five years. Many people have asked the Spurs to share how their lives have been dramatically and positively affected by being a part of a loving, caring, supportive, prayerful and Christ-centered group of women. Many of these stories have never been told or written. Their joys and sorrows are the threads that make the beautiful Spur tapestry. There are stories with tragic situations that end with a redemptive quality that will encourage any reader. Some stories will make you laugh and remind you how much fun it is to be a Christian. There is hardly a life circumstance that the Spurs have not experienced. Their stories confirm the fact that being a Christian does not guarantee a smooth journey through life. They are proof that God is faithful, prayer works, joy comes in the morning and His Word is Truth. Be encouraged.

For nearly all peoples of the world, the sword embodied the spirit of chivalry, symbolized justice and martyrdom and represented courage and freedom. In battle, it served universally as a deadly offensive weapon.\nDrawing on a wealth of literary, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, and other sources, the author traces the sword's origins, from its birth as a charred and sharpened stick, through its diverse stages of development, to its full growth in the early Roman Empire. Recounting man's long association with this weapon, the author describes in brilliant detail:\nThe ages of wood, bone and born\nThe appearance of stone swords and exotic weapons such as the boomerang\nThe ages of copper and alloys such as bronze and brass -- used in producing the long, narrow blades of rapiers\nThe Iron Age during which the Viking sword of carbonized iron took shape -- a weapon whose form would set the standard for the next thousand years.\nEnhanced by nearly 300 excellent line drawings, the text provides an incredible wealth of detailed data about the sword and its variations: sabre, broadsword, cutlass, scimitar, rapier, foil, and a host of other arms, including dirks, daggers, throwing knives, flails, and much more.\nMilitary and social historians, scholars and students of weaponry, as well as armchair adventurers will find this volume a fascinating, abundantly illustrated and highly readable account of this potent symbol of power.","title_az":"The Book of the Sword: With 293 Illustrations (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)","rank":69471.0,"category":"Europe"},{"isbn":"0806510080","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Rain Maiden","author_name":"Jill M.

They're both part of Louis Fantasia's approach in Instant Shakespeare. Mr. Fantasia, the first American to direct at the Shakespeare Globe Centre and a distinguished member of the international theatre community, has developed a pragmatic and uniquely American performance technique. Expanded and refined in performances and workshops throughout the world, Instant Shakespeare allows performers, directors, and teachers of all cultures and levels of experience to demystify Shakespeare and perform his texts in ways that are clear, fresh, and unpretentious. Mr. Fantasia's methods are solidly grounded in a rigorous analysis of the text and structure of Shakespeare's plays, and enriched by his insight into Elizabethan performance practices gleaned from his intimate association with the reconstruction of the Globe. Through Instant Shakespeare, novices and professionals alike achieve the textual clarity, nuanced characters, and dynamic actions that drive the most vigorous Shakespearean performances. Mr. Fantasia's respectful but irreverent approach pinpoints the shortcomings of contemporary Shakespeare practice and training, particularly generic and postmodern interpretations, and confronts theatre artists with the importance of conscious personal responsibility for the creative process. Employing analogies from music and architecture, he insists upon the hard and sometimes tedious work that necessarily underlies solid artistic choices. Mr. Fantasia shows how to understand Shakespeare's vocabulary as well as the structure and essential dramatic event of each play. He provides exercise monologues, exercise scenes, and tools for textual analysis; explains correct breathing; and lays out his philosophies of training and performance.","title_az":"Instant Shakespeare: A Proven Technique for Actors, Directors, and Teachers","rank":1980160.0,"category":"PerformingArts"},{"isbn":"1450470432","asin":null,"title_gr":"Measurement and Evaluation in Human Performance with Web Study Guide 5th Edition","author_name":"James R.

His fame is based chiefly on his World War II service in the Philippines. Yet Korea, America's forgotten war, was far more \"MacArthur's War\" -- and it remains one of our most brutal and frightening. In just three years thirty-five thousand Americans lost their lives -- more than three times the rate of losses in Vietnam. Korea, like Vietnam, was a breeding ground for the crimes of war. To this day, six thousand Americans remain MIA. It was Korea where American troops faced a Communist foe for the first time, as both China and the Soviet Union contributed troops to the North Korean cause. The war that nearly triggered the use of nuclear weapons reveals MacArthur at his most flamboyant, flawed, yet still, at times, brilliant. Acclaimed historian Stanley Weintraub offers a thrilling blow-by-blow account of the key actions of the Korean War during the months of MacArthur's command. Our lack of preparedness for the invasion, our disastrous retreat to a corner of Korea, the daring landing at Inchon, the miscalculations in pursuing the enemy north, the headlong retreats from the Yalu River and Chosin Reservoir, and the clawing back to the 38th parallel, all can be blamed or credited to MacArthur. He was imperious, vain, blind to criticism, and so insubordinate that Truman was forced to fire him. Yet years later, the war would end where MacArthur had left it, at the border that still stands as one of history's last frontiers between communism and freedom.\n\"MacArthur's War\" draws on extensive archival research, memoirs, and the latest findings from archives in the formerly communist world, to weave a rich tale in thevoices of its participants. From MacArthur and his upper cadre, to feisty combat correspondent Maggie Higgins and her fellow journalists, to the grunts who bore the brunt of MacArthur's decisions, for good and ill, this is a harrowing account of modern warfare at its bloodiest. \"MacArthur's War\" is the gripping story of the Korean War and its soldiers -- and of the one soldier who dominated the rest.","title_az":"MacArthur's War : Korea and the Undoing of an American Hero","rank":575284.0,"category":"Asia"},{"isbn":"1423175689","asin":null,"title_gr":"Super Saurus Saves Kindergarten","author_name":"Deborah Underwood","top_genre":"picture-books","publisher":"Disney-Hyperion","publication_year":2017.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":40.0,"average_rating":3.52,"ratings_count":75.0,"text_reviews_count":25.0,"description":"Arnold has a plan.\nThe evil genius Zorgo-disguised as Mr. Zachary-will never stop him.

How do we correctly speak of the real Jesus without falling prey to the skepticism that marks the so-called \"quest for a historical Jesus\"?\nIn The Jesus We Missed, pastor and scholar Patrick Henry Reardon travels through the Gospel narratives to discover the real Jesus, to see him through the eyes of those who knew him best--the apostles, his community, believers who vividly portrayed him in stories filtered through their own faith.

Through the meanings associated with smells, osmologies develop--what cultural anthropologists have termed the systems that utilize smells to classify people and objects in ways that define their relations to each other and their relative values within a particular culture. European Christians, for instance, relied on their noses to differentiate Christians from heathens, whites from people of color, women from men, virgins from harlots, artisans from aristocracy, and pollution from perfume.\nThis reliance on smell was not limited to the global North.

Published originally in pulp magazines, his works have grown in popularity since his death, so that more than thirty editions are currently in print.\nYet only recently has Lovecraft received serious attention from literary critics. And until now no one has examined his work from a post-structuralist perspective. Donald Burleson fills that void, for the first time in an extended study bringing the resources of deconstruction to bear on the works of this modern gothicist.\nIn an introductory overview, Burleson gives an unusually readable account of deconstruction theory and terminology, a field all too often discussed in densely opaque fashion. He goes on to deconstruct thirteen Lovecraft stories, delving into their fascinating etymological mazes, abundant ambiguities, and shifting levels of meanings. His lively and remarkably jargon-free readings explore Lovecraft's rich figurality to unprecedented depths.\nAt the same time Burleson develops the view that in practicing self-subversion and structural displacement, literary texts perpetuate themselves. His final chapter explores the broad themes running though Lovecraft's fiction, arguing that these themes in themselves prefigure the deconstructive gesture.\nThis insightful and provocative volume will go a long way toward displacing the label of popular writer and establishing Lovecraft as an important figure in American literature.","title_az":"Lovecraft: Disturbing the Universe","rank":2736192.0,"category":"GenreFiction"},{"isbn":"0748609075","asin":null,"title_gr":"Islamic Medicine: Western Descent Narratives Since 1945","author_name":"Manfred Ullmann","top_genre":"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645-\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629","publisher":"Edinburgh University Press","publication_year":1997.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":136.0,"average_rating":3.8,"ratings_count":4.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"In our own intellectual and scientific heritage Islamic medicine plays a much greater part than is usually realised.

The author shows how translations into Arabic of medical works, mainly from the Greek tradition, led to the renewal of this tradition in the Islamic world and then to its Islamisation. After a brief account of the development of Islamic medicine and its transmission to Europe, he goes on to explain some of its main concepts - its system of human physiology, its ideas about the nature of disease and how infection is transmitted, its rules for diet and the use of drugs.

Psychois a film that can be used to present the structures of composition and cutting, narrative and genre building, and point of view. The film is also a highpoint of the horror genre and an instigator of all the slasher films to come in its wake. The essays in the casebook cover all of these elements and more. They also serve another purpose: presented chronologically, they represent the changes in the methodologies of film criticism, from the first journalist reviews and early auteurist approaches, through current psychoanalytic and gender criticism.

Crossing town one evening to meet up with Gerti's Jewish lover, a blockade cuts off the girls' path -- it is the Furher in a motorcade procession, and the crowd goes mad striving to catch a glimpse of Hitler's raised \"empty hand.\" Then the parade is over, and in the long hours after midnight Sanna and Gerti will face betrayal, death, and the heartbreaking reality of being young in an era devoid of innocence or romance.\nIn 1937, German author Irmgard Keun had only recently fled Nazi Germany with her lover Joseph Roth when she wrote this slim, exquisite, and devastating book.

As an American who had lived in the UK for years, he knew the British could be a bit eccentric. However, nothing could prepare him for the sight of men-and women-flinging themselves off a grassy cliff in pursuit of a cheese. He soon realized that Britain has dozens of seemingly lunatic acts enshrined as traditions: events with strange names like gurning, shin kicking, horn dancing, and faggot cutting.True Brits is the hilarious account of JR's trek around England, Scotland, and Wales, as well as a bit of Northern Ireland in London's backyard. From \"Darkie Day\" and the English summer \"Olimpicks\" to Pope burning on Bonfire Night, JR uncovers the people and places that make Britain great ... and at times, not so great.\nIn his quest to find out why the British do such extraordinary things, JR talks to countless characters, catches them in action, and even takes part in the events himself. Along the way, he discovers that these ancient pastimes provide surprising insights into 21st-century Britain-as well as America.","title_az":"True Brits: A Tour of Britain In All Its Bog-Snorkeling, Shin-Kicking and Cheese-Rolling Glory","rank":5575035.0,"category":"Europe"},{"isbn":"1595324313","asin":null,"title_gr":"Saiyuki, Vol. 6","author_name":"Kazuya Minekura","top_genre":"manga","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.3,"ratings_count":739.0,"text_reviews_count":12.0,"description":null,"title_az":"Saiyuki, Vol. 6","rank":1916079.0,"category":"Manga"},{"isbn":"1427804664","asin":null,"title_gr":"Saiyuki Reload, Volume 8","author_name":"Kazuya Minekura","top_genre":"manga","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":196.0,"average_rating":4.33,"ratings_count":347.0,"text_reviews_count":9.0,"description":null,"title_az":"Saiyuki Reload Volume 8 (v. 8)","rank":924785.0,"category":"Manga"},{"isbn":"1849165505","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Highland Furies: The Black Watch 1739-1899","author_name":"Victoria Schofield","top_genre":"history","publisher":"Quercus Publishing","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":538.0,"average_rating":4.14,"ratings_count":5.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"As the oldest of the Highland Regiments, The Black Watch has an enviable roster of Battle Honours and a mystique born of repeated service on behalf of King, Queen and country.\nOn the strength of her acclaimed biography of Field Marshal Earl Wavell, the regimental trustees commissioned Victoria Schofield to write this, the first volume of her magisterial history of the The Black Watch, and have fully cooperated with her as she traces the story of the Regiment from its early 18th-century beginnings through to the eve of the South African War at the end of the 19th-century.\nOriginating as companies of highland men raised to keep a 'watch' over the Highlands of Scotland, they were formed into a regiment in 1739. Its soldiers would go on to fight with extraordinary bravery and A(c)lan in almost every major engagement fought by the British Army during this period, from the American War of Independence, the Peninsular Wars, Waterloo, the Crimea, Indian Mutiny to Egypt and the Sudan.\nDrawing on diaries, letters and memoirs, Victoria Schofield skilfully weaves the multiple strands of this story into an epic narrative of a valiant body of officers and men over one-and-a-half centuries. In her sure hands, the story of The Black Watch is no arid recitation of campaigns, dates and battle honours, but is instead a rich and compelling record of the soldier's experience under fire and on campaign. It is also a celebration of the deeds of a regiment that has played a unique role in British history and a vivid insight into the lives of the many remarkable figures who have marched and fought so proudly under its Colours.","title_az":"Highland Furies: The Black Watch 1739-1899","rank":2691651.0,"category":"Europe"},{"isbn":"1480292745","asin":null,"title_gr":"Mending Broken","author_name":"Teresa B.

It's an overview of THE GABORS, three unlikely but ferociously glamorous siblings who obsessively \"boot-strapped\" themselves into \"television-age\" celebrities who became famous merely for being famous. On the surface, at least, their stylish and glittering myths and legends represent the fulfillment of some aspect of every immigrant woman's dream.\nThe force behind the strip-off of the sisters' diamonds, ermine, and sable is celebrity biographer Darwin Porter, who is already well known for his award-winning overviews of myth vs. reality in the Entertainment Industry. His knowledge base about the glamour queens' lives in Central Europe, prior to their assault on Hollywood, has been described as \"encyclopedic.\"\nHow were the Gabors trained, who advised them, and what were the social contexts and \"glamour quotients\" which applied to their conquests of what evolved, collectively into 20 famous, attractive, and\/or fabulously rich husbands? And to what degree did they compete for the attention and approval of their charming but shrewd and \"tough as nails\" matriarch, Jolie?\nAll of these questions, and more, are richly and abundantly answered in this hot new biography\n\"We have a tiger by the tail, thanks to the timing of this book,\" said Danforth Prince, Blood Moon's president. \"Everything previously published about the Gabors has been heavy on the 'camp' factor and superficial about the historical and political contexts in which these charming ladies thrived. The Gabors themselves, through misinformation and 'artfully unspecific' references to the embarrassing aspects of their individual histories, certainly contributed to what has become a 'mink-and-diamond curtain.' All of that has changed, thanks to the investigative zeal with which Darwin Porter has pursued his craft.\"\n\"This book will intrigue the enquiring mind of anyone who ever saw a late-night episode of Merv Griffin, Johnny Carson, or Green Acres, and anyone who ever studied the evolution of Pop Culture in the wake of the devastation of World War II,\" Prince continued. \"It's a true-life tale about LOVE, DECEIT, PASSION, MANIPULATIONS, BETRAYALS, BEAUTY, WIT, GLAMOUR, and HOLLYWOOD. It's a tale about how three newcomers, fleeing toward the American Dream from the ruins of Postwar Europe, conquered Hollywood with their unique combination of Guts, Glamour, and Goulash.","title_az":"Those Glamorous Gabors: Bombshells from Budapest","rank":511668.0,"category":"Leaders&NotablePeople"},{"isbn":"0231064632","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Mufti of Jerusalem: Muhammad Amin Al-Husayni and the Palestinian Question","author_name":"Philip Mattar","top_genre":"palestine","publisher":"Columbia University Press","publication_year":1988.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":158.0,"average_rating":3.67,"ratings_count":9.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"Muhammad Amin al-Husayni, the principal leader of Palestinian nationalism during the British mandate, was one of the modern Arab world's most controversial figures.

During his first, between 1917 and 1936, he was a cautious and pragmatic leader who, while opposing Zionism, cooperated with the British mandatory officials. The second phase, however, after 1936, was marked by militancy, frustration, and ultimately failure.","title_az":"The  Mufti of Jerusalem: Al-Hajj Amin Al-Husayni and the Palestinian National Movement","rank":3190007.0,"category":"Humanities"},{"isbn":"1936111233","asin":null,"title_gr":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens Workbook (New Size: 8' X 11\": A Companion to the International Best-Selling Book the Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens","author_name":"Sean Covey","top_genre":"self-help","publisher":"Franklin Covey","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":62.0,"average_rating":4.03,"ratings_count":21.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"THE ULTIMATE TEENAGE SUCCESS GUIDE -- Being a teenager is both wonderful and challenging.

During the domination of their world by that sophisticated and ruthless people, the Narn were slaves in all but name; forced to watch as their world was stripped of everything of value. And when at last they succeeded in driving the hated dictators from Narn space, they were left with little but their freedom.\nThey hate the Centauri, but have learned from them. The Narn sought out other worlds, rich with resources to supply their beggared home-world. They found them. And when those worlds had native populations, the Narn conquered them, enslaved them, and exploited them as ruthlessly as ever the Centauri at their worst might have. Now, the Centauri have struck again at the Narn and the two powers are embroiled in battle. It is a time when an enslaved people might see an opportunity to strike at their enemy; perhaps win their freedom. But in every conflict there comes a lull, a time when exhaustion temporarily causes even the bitterest opponents to call a truce, to rest and recoup, a time when allies try to make peace between the combatants, a time when reluctant rebels might hope for a peaceful solution before they drench their own hands in blood.\nBabylon 5 will host a conference between the Narn and the Centauri.

Drawing on original research, Evan Schwartz debunks popular misconceptions and shows how the people, places, and events in Baum's life gave birth to his unforgettable images and characters. The Yellow Brick Road was real, the Emerald City evoked the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, and Baum's mother-in-law, the radical women's rights leader Matilda Joslyn Gage, inspired his dual view of witches--as good and wicked.\nA narrative that sweeps across late nineteenth-century America, Finding Ozultimately reveals how failure and heartbreak can sometimes lead to redemption and bliss, and how one individual can ignite the imagination of the entire world.","title_az":"Finding Oz: How L.

I was hardly more than a baby myself, just turned twenty-four and starting my third year of medical school.\"--from Birth Day \nSo began Mark Sloan's three-decades-long exploration of the wonders and oddities of human childbirth. Pediatrician, husband, and father, the author has attended nearly three thousand births since that long-ago summer, encountering everything from routine deliveries to tense labor-room dramas. In Birth Day, Sloan draws on his personal and professional experience to weave the strands of memoir, history, science, and culture into a fascinating--and often funny--tapestry of this fundamental human passage.\nBirth Day takes the reader on a remarkable journey, from the dawn of human history to the quiet efficiency of a modern operating room; from Aristotle and Julius Caesar to a trailblazing, cross-dressing British army surgeon; from a recent past filled with the horrors of childbirth gone wrong to a present day, in which every pregnancy is expected to end happily. Some of Birth Day's many topics include\n* The evolution of human childbirth--or, why do gorillas have it so easy?\n* The first five minutes of life--scuba divers, astronauts, and the amazing adaptations that transform a fetus into an air-breathing, out-in-the-world baby\n* Cesarean section--a look at its origins, its future, and how it came to be the most frequently performed operation in American hospitals\n* Pain and politics--the age-old quest for painless childbirth, starring Adam and Eve, Queen Victoria, a nineteenth-century medical brawl, and the rise of today's \"epidural monoculture\"\n* Daddies--raging paternal hormones, hidden anxieties, and the emotional evolution of men (including the author, his father, and grandfather) as they approach fatherhood\n* The five senses at birth--does light enter the womb? how loud is it in there? what is a newborn baby searching for with those first anxious glances?\n* A tour of the newborn body--springy skulls, hairy ears, innies and outies, the advantages (and disadvantages) of looking like your father, and why the United States is one of the world's most circumcised nations\nDelightfully instructive and entertaining, Birth Dayoffers a fresh, sometimes irreverent take on a universally familiar topic. Warm, reassuring, and packed with stories from the author's work and life, this unique book is one pediatrician's meditation on the hiding-in-plain-sight marvels of human birth.","title_az":"Birth Day: A Pediatrician Explores the Science, the History, and the Wonder of Childbirth","rank":2468006.0,"category":"WomensHealth"},{"isbn":"0596000413","asin":null,"title_gr":"Web Database Applications with PHP, and MySQL","author_name":"Hugh E.

In Movie Freak, his enthrallingly candid, funny, and eye-opening memoir, Gleiberman captures what it's like to live life through the movies, existing in thrall to a virtual reality that becomes, over time, more real than reality itself.\nGleiberman paints a bittersweet portrait of his complicated and ultimately doomed friendship with Pauline Kael, the legendary New Yorkerfilm critic who was his mentor and muse. He also offers an unprecedented inside look at what the experience of being a critic is really all about, detailing his stint at The Boston Phoenixand then, starting in 1990, at EW, where he becomes a voice of obsession battling-to a fault-to cling to his independence.\nGleiberman explores the movies that shaped him, from the films that first made him want to be a critic (Nashvilleand Carrie), to what he hails as the sublime dark trilogy of the 1980s (Blue Velvet, Sid and Nancy, and Manhunter), to the scruffy humanity of Dazed and Confused,to the brilliant madness of Natural Born Killers,to the transcendence of Breaking the Waves,to the pop rapture of Moulin Rouge! He explores his partnership with Lisa Schwarzbaum and his friendships and encounters with such figures as Oliver Stone, Russell Crowe, Richard Linklater, and Ben Affleck. He also writes with confessional intimacy about his romantic relationships and how they echoed the behavior of his bullying, philandering father. And he talks about what film criticism is becoming in the digital age: a cacophony of voices threatened by an insidious new kind of groupthink.\nUltimately, Movie Freakis about the primal pleasure of film and the enigmatic dynamic between critic and screen. For Gleiberman, the moving image has a talismanic power, but it also represents a kind of sweet sickness, a magnificent obsession that both consumes and propels him.","title_az":"Movie Freak: My Life Watching Movies","rank":909031.0,"category":"Arts&amp;Literature"},{"isbn":"0316381152","asin":null,"title_gr":"For a Little While: New and Selected Stories","author_name":"Rick Bass","top_genre":"short-stories","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","publication_year":2016.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":480.0,"average_rating":4.23,"ratings_count":188.0,"text_reviews_count":38.0,"description":"Long considered one of the most gifted practitioners of the short story, Rick Bass is unsurpassed in his ability to perceive and portray the enduring truths of the human heart.

A compilation of heartfelt letters written from a pastor to his people that explains Jesus' work on the cross.\nDeath by Love is a unique book on the cross of Jesus Christ. While many books debate the finer points of the doctrine of the atonement, what is often lost are the real-life implications of Jesus' death on the cross for those who have sinned and have been sinned against. Written in the form of pastoral letters, Death by Love outlines the twelve primary effects of Jesus' death on the cross and connects each to the life of a different individual.\nDriscoll, one of America's most influential pastors, and Breshears, a respected theologian, help readers understand, appreciate, and trust in Jesus' work on the cross in a way that will transform their lives.

The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.\nWe've long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, we've shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through \"menial\" jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.\nThrough fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.\nHow did we get to this tangled place? How do we change the way we work? With great insight and wisdom, Schwartz shows us how to take our first steps toward understanding, and empowering us all to find great work.","title_az":"Why We Work (TED Books)","rank":90967.0,"category":"HumanResources"},{"isbn":"1941393233","asin":null,"title_gr":"Out Came the Sun: Overcoming the Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction, and Suicide in My Family","author_name":"Mariel Hemingway","top_genre":"memoir","publisher":"Regan Arts.","publication_year":2015.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":288.0,"average_rating":3.36,"ratings_count":614.0,"text_reviews_count":100.0,"description":"A moving, compelling memoir about growing up and escaping the tragic legacy of mental illness, suicide, addiction, and depression in one of America's most famous families: the Hemingways.\nShe opens her eyes. The room is dark. She hears yelling, smashed plates, and wishes it was all a terrible dream. But it isn't. This is what it was like growing up as a Hemingway. In this deeply moving, searingly honest new memoir, actress and mental health icon Mariel Hemingway shares in candid detail the story of her troubled childhood in a famous family haunted by depression, alcoholism, illness, and suicide. Born just a few months after her grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, shot himself, it was Mariel's mission as a girl to escape the desperate cycles of severe mental health issues that had plagued generations of her family.\nSurrounded by a family tortured by alcoholism (both parents), depression (her sister Margaux), suicide (her grandfather and four other members of her family), schizophrenia (her sister Muffet), and cancer (mother), it was all the young Mariel could do to keep her head. In a compassionate voice she reveals her painful struggle to stay sane as the youngest child in her family, and how she coped with the chaos by becoming OCD and obsessive about her food, schedule, and organization.\nThe twisted legacy of her family has never quite let go of Mariel, but now in this memoir she opens up about her claustrophobic marriage, her acting career, and turning to spiritual healers and charlatans for solace. Ultimately Mariel has written a story of triumph about learning to overcome her family's demons and developing love and deep compassion for them. At last, in this memoir she can finally tell the true story of the tragedies and troubles of the Hemingway family, and she delivers a book that beckons comparisons with Mary Karr and Jeanette Walls.","title_az":"Out Came the Sun: Overcoming the Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction, and Suicide in My Family","rank":482874.0,"category":"Death&Grief"},{"isbn":"1941393276","asin":null,"title_gr":"Art of the Pimp, The","author_name":"Dennis Hof","top_genre":"first-reads","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.31,"ratings_count":80.0,"text_reviews_count":20.0,"description":"Dennis Hof, proprietor of the world-famous Moonlite BunnyRanch brothel and the P.T.

Sensually attuned and politically radical, they were among the most influential thinkers and artists of the day, from Richard Burton to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Morris. These iconoclasts not only navigated the fringes of sexual deviance with their bodies but also carried the pleasures of the body into their work, creating a taboo-loving counterculture whose reverberations can be felt today.

National Geographic Explorer Dan Buettner has traveled the globe to uncover the best strategies for longevity found in the Blue Zones: places in the world where higher percentages of people enjoy remarkably long, full lives. And in this dynamic book he discloses the recipe, blending this unique lifestyle formula with the latest scientific findings to inspire easy, lasting change that may add years to your life.\nBuettner's colossal research effort, funded in part by the National Institute on Aging, has taken him from Costa Rica to Italy to Japan and beyond.

A book no one else could have written, The Longest Raceis his urgent exploration of the connection between individual endurance and a sustainable society.\nThe Longest Racebegins at the starting line of the 2001 JFK 50 Mile--the nation's oldest and largest ultramarathon and, like other such races, an epic test of human limits and aspiration. At age sixty, his sights set on breaking the age-division record, Ayres embarks on a course over the rocky ridge of the Appalachian Trail, along the headwind-buffeted towpath of the Potomac River, and past momentous Civil War sites such as Harpers Ferry and Antietam.\nBut even as Ayres focuses on concerns familiar to every endurance runner--starting strong and setting the right pace, the art of breathing, overcoming fatigue, mindfulness for the course ahead--he finds himself as preoccupied with the future of our planet as with the finish line of this 50-mile race.\nA veteran journalist and environmental editor who harbors deep anxiety about our longterm prospects, Ayres helps us to understand how the skills and mindset necessary to complete an ultramarathon are also essential for grappling anew with the imperative to endure--not only as individuals, but as a society--and not just for 50 miles, but in the longest race we are all called upon to run.","title_az":"The Longest Race: A Lifelong Runner, an Iconic Ultramarathon, and the Case for Human Endurance","rank":2293031.0,"category":"IndividualSports"},{"isbn":"0984125868","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Firefly Dance","author_name":"Sarah Addison Allen","top_genre":"magical-realism","publisher":"Bell Bridge Books","publication_year":2011.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":200.0,"average_rating":3.56,"ratings_count":61.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"Bright lights flicker in the dark evenings of summer.

The last thing she wants to do is to fall in love with another baby parrot! But one look at the tiny grey ball of fluff and Shannon just knows-he is love with wings, and they are meant to be together.\nA lifelong parrot lover but by no means experienced at caring for cockatiels, Shannon quickly assumes the role of eager student, with Pearl as her willing and equally eager teacher. From negotiating victuals preferences to socializing with the parrot-phobic, making home improvements to avoiding the dreaded V.E.T., Shannon learns from her feathery sidekick how to meet his basic needs, offer extra enrichment, nurture and care for him, and be nurtured and cared for in return.\nPearl, in turn, opens a window for Shannon into a refreshing new world full of self-acceptance, self-respect, trust, laughter, love, and FUN. In Pearl's world, everyone is a potential new friend, every mirror reflects prettiness, every meal is a celebration of good food and good company, and each new day is a great day to celebrate being YOU.\nToday, 12 years after their first meeting, Shannon and Pearl are still blissfully joined at the beak. Love & Feathers, a book based on the popular blog by the same name, is their story.","title_az":"LOVE &amp; FEATHERS: What a Palm-Sized Parrot Has Taught Me About Life, Love, and Healthy Self-Esteem","rank":1274448.0,"category":"Pets&amp;AnimalCare"},{"isbn":"0226253252","asin":null,"title_gr":"Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact","author_name":"Ludwik Fleck","top_genre":"history","publisher":"University Of Chicago Press","publication_year":1981.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":222.0,"average_rating":4.22,"ratings_count":121.0,"text_reviews_count":13.0,"description":"Originally published in German in 1935, this monograph anticipated solutions to problems of scientific progress, the truth of scientific fact and the role of error in science now associated with the work of Thomas Kuhn and others.

And as Kuhn observes in his foreword, \"Though much has occurred since its publication, it remains a brilliant and largely unexploited resource.\"\n\"To many scientists just as to many historians and philosophers of science facts are things that simply are the case: they are discovered through properly passive observation of natural reality. To such views Fleck replies that facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction, a madething.

Written in reaction to the stultifying system of rote learning and memorization prevalent throughout Europe in Rousseau's time,Emileis a utopian vision of child-centered education, full of the sentiments of Romanticism, which Rousseau himself inspired.\nImagining a typical boy named Emile, Rousseau creates an ideal model of one-on-one tutelage from infancy to manhood with himself as the child's mentor. \"Everything is good as it comes from the hands of the Author of Nature; but everything degenerates in the hands of man.\" This is the first of many provocative statements that characterize this work and are a hallmark of Rousseau's arresting rhetoric. As in so many of his other famous works, here too Rousseau asserts his main thesis that human beings by nature are good; it is only the distorting influences of civilization that have corrupted them.\nIf this is true, then in educating children one must do nothing to interfere with human nature in its natural course. Far from being the chief means by which society inculcates its rules and principles, education should be the method of helping youths discover the inherent truths of their own human nature. From infancy to young adulthood learning should come purely from personal experience. Rather than imparting facts, teachers should foster self-discovery, so that knowledge is acquired through following innate curiosity, not vicariously through the statements of others.\nEducators as well as students of philosophy will find much to admire in Rousseau's original and still radical ideas.","title_az":"Emile: Or Treatise on Education (Great Books in Philosophy)","rank":826915.0,"category":"Schools&Teaching"},{"isbn":"0684836386","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Division of Labor in Society","author_name":"Emile Durkheim","top_genre":"philosophy","publisher":"Free Press","publication_year":1997.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":416.0,"average_rating":3.79,"ratings_count":1313.0,"text_reviews_count":28.0,"description":"Originally published in 1893 and never out of print, Emile Durkheim's groundbreaking work remains one of the cornerstone texts of the sociological canon--now updated and re-translated in this new edition.As the Industrial Revolution was changing the landscape of society, Durkheim presented a new vision of the social structures at the root of capitalism, and the issues he grappled with still resound today. If pre-industrial societies were held together by common values, sentiments, and norms, equally shared by all, what holds modern societies, with their complex division of labor and non-cohesive social structure, together? What did this new social order mean for the autonomy of the individual? Durkheim argued that class conflict is not inherent in a capitalist society, as Marx contended, but that the unfettered growth of state power would lead to the extinction of individuality. Only in a free society that promotes voluntary bonds between its members, Durkheim suggested, can individuality prosper.\nIn this new edition, the first since 1984, world-renowned Durkheim scholar Steven Lukes revisits and revises the original translation to enhance clarity, accuracy, and fluency for the contemporary reader. Lukes also highlights Durkheim's arguments by putting them into historical context with a timeline of important information.

But what are the core issues and concerns, the ones that must be addressed if the church is to follow God's leading into the future? Laying aside what can be merely tweaked or adjusted, what must the UMC -reset- about itself? Lovett Weems, one of the most highly-respected interpreters of contemporary United Methodism, suggests that we start with the following: - What will happen now that the increased giving that United Methodists have enjoyed (despite declining membership numbers) has reached a plateau and begun to decline? - Why, with 34,000 congregations and $6.5 billion in annual giving, can't United Methodists add a net increase of even 1 new disciple of Jesus Christ in a given year? - Why are United Methodist clergy less concerned with reaching young adults than are laity? Why are laity unwilling to make the changes to worship and budgets required to attract these same young adults? - If the percentage of married couples with young children has declined by half since the 1950s, why is that still the group we focus on reaching? - Why are so many mid-sized churches on their way to becoming small-membership congregations? With insight, conviction, and calm resolve, Lovett Weems challenges United Methodists not only to ask these hard questions, but to face up to the difficult decisions they require of us as we continue to seek God's will for our lives together.","title_az":"Focus: The Real Challenges That Face The United Methodist Church (Adaptive Leadership Series)","rank":1389446.0,"category":"Protestantism"},{"isbn":"1616264551","asin":null,"title_gr":"Love Finds a Home: 3 Historical Romances Make Falling in Love Simple and Sweet","author_name":"Wanda E.

Renowned for his political activism and social media activity almost as much as for his social interventions, contemporary approach to the readymade, and knowledge of Chinese traditional crafts, Ai s fame extends throughout and beyond the art world.Drawn from TASCHEN s limited Collector s Edition, this monograph explores each of Ai s career phases up until his release from Chinese custody. It features extensive visual material to trace Ai s development from his early New York days right through to his recent practice. Focus moments include his international breakthrough in the early 2000s, his porcelain Sunflower Seeds at the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern, his response to the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, and his police detention in 2011. With behind-the-scenes studio pictures, production shots, and numerous statements derived from exclusive interviews with Ai, we gain privileged access to the artist s process, influences, and importance.The book includes texts from Uli Sigg, Ai s longtime friend and former Swiss ambassador to China; Roger M. Buergel, who curated the 2007 documentary and hosted the artist s Fairytale piece; and experts on Chinese culture and politics: Carlos Rojas, William A. Callahan, and James J.

There is really nothing to compete with it for its broad scope and lively, easy style.\"\n-- John Ziman, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Bristol, and Fellow of the Royal Society. \"The fish's streamlined shape reveals functional knowledge of the physical properties of water.... The deadly effectiveness of the cobra's venom shows useful knowledge of the physiology of its prey.... Indeed, knowledge itself may be broadly conceived as the fit of some aspect of an organism to some aspect of its environment, whether it be the fit of the butterfly's long siphon of a mouth to the flowers from which it feeds or the fit of the astrophysicist's theories to the structure of the universe. ... But how did such remarkable instances of fit arise? How did the animate world obtain its impressive knowledge of its surroundings? And how do organisms continue to acquire knowledge and thereby increase their fit during their lifetimes?\" In this sweeping account of the emergence of fit, Gary Cziko integrates numerous scientific disciplines within the perspective of a universal selection theory that attempts to account for all cases of fit involving living organisms, including those that might appear miraculous. Cziko's bold assertion is that all novel forms of adapted complexity -- whether single-celled organisms or scientific theories -- emerge from an evolutionary process involving cumulative blind variation and selection.\nWithout Miracles describes many remarkable examples of the fit of various structures, behaviors, and products of living organisms to their environmentsin a broad synthesis of humankind's attempt to understand the emergence of complex, adapted entities. These explanations range from the providential accounts of the early philosophers and \"natural theologians, \" through instructionist theories of the type proposed by Lamarck, to an ongoing \"second Darwinian revolution\" in which natural and artificial selection are being applied to many fields of science to both explain the emergence of naturally occurring adapted complexity and to facilitate the design of useful products ranging from microbes to computer programs.","title_az":"Without Miracles: Universal Selection Theory and the Second Darwinian Revolution","rank":3027462.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"1600105165","asin":null,"title_gr":"Angel: Aftermath (Volume 5)","author_name":"Kelley Armstrong","top_genre":"graphic-novels","publisher":null,"publication_year":2009.0,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":3.74,"ratings_count":1077.0,"text_reviews_count":52.0,"description":"Springing out of Joss Whedon's Angel: After the Fall story line, novelist Kelley Armstrong (The Summoning) comes aboard to explore the many repercussions following the explosive last issue of Angel: After the Fall.

In the process, he exposes one of the most under-reported events of the 20th Century: Joseph Stalin's mass deportation of nearly 2 million Polish citizens to the Siberian Gulags and the life-and-death events that followed--from Siberia to the Middle East and ultimately, Eastern Africa. But the author's quest takes a dramatic turn.

A year later her skeletal remains were found in a trash dump.\nIn 1995, the body of 42-year-old Gary Clark was discovered in a wooded lot about three miles south of Madisonville, Kentucky. He had been killed at another location by a single gunshot wound and his body dumped in the woods.\nIn both cases, the police initially found no leads or physical evidence.\nThese are just two examples of cold casescrimes that stymie investigators and sometimes remain unsolved for many years. But for the painstaking, dedicated work of law enforcement professionals who reinvestigate and revive cases that others once abandoned, justice might never be served and lack of closure forever torment the families and friends of crime victims.\nDelayed Justice documents the heroic efforts of some of the nation's most prolific cold case detectives. In collaboration with authors Jack and Mary Branson, these professionals share their insights, skills, and resources, using their most compelling cold cases as illustrations.\nThe authors examine how cold case investigations differ from standard investigations and why cold case detectives sometimes have success where earlier investigators failed. They also discuss some of the pitfalls of reopening long-unsolved crimes, such as lost or compromised evidence and the difficulty of getting accurate information from witnesses who must rely on fading memories. Looking to the future, the authors discuss new technology that may someday allow investigators to drastically enhance surveillance videos and create a facial recognition database as accurate as DNA analysis and fingerprints.\nBoth true crime readers and fellow law enforcement professionals will find the stories and expert insights described in this book to be fascinating and instructive.","title_az":"Delayed Justice: Inside Stories from America's Best Cold Case Investigators","rank":2135745.0,"category":"TrueCrime"},{"isbn":"0873586948","asin":null,"title_gr":"Grandmother Spider Brings the Sun: A Cherokee Story","author_name":"Geri Keams","top_genre":"picture-books","publisher":"Cooper Square Pub","publication_year":1997.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":32.0,"average_rating":4.26,"ratings_count":47.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"This wonderful story by a renowned storyteller explains how light was brought to the dark side of the world.","title_az":"Grandmother Spider Brings the Sun: A Cherokee Story","rank":301604.0,"category":"Literature&Fiction"},{"isbn":"1484714490","asin":null,"title_gr":"Ant-Man: Zombie Repellent: A Mighty Marvel Chapter Book","author_name":"Chris Wyatt","top_genre":"marvel","publisher":"Marvel Press","publication_year":2015.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":128.0,"average_rating":4.17,"ratings_count":26.0,"text_reviews_count":4.0,"description":"Scott Lang, AKA Ant-Man, might be the smalles Super Hero, but he has the biggest heart.

Author Mark Jacobson and his wife, Nancy Bray Cardozo, decided that their family--the three kids and two parents--had reached a mutual moment of decision. Things were tense in the house. Their precocious, darling oldest daughter Rae was raging through teenagehood, staying out late, flunking out of school. The other two, Rosalie and Billy, teenagers-in-training, were spending way too much time in front of the TV. This desultory equation, the parents thought, in their admittedly slapdash way, could only be changed by the introduction of something radical, something big. The World was big. The World was radical. The World would get everyone's attention. To the World they would go, and too bad about the cries and whines of der kinder. It would be FOR THEIR OWN GOOD. So they went, on their particular baedeker, a journey into what the parents surmised would constitute a touch of The Real: Thailand, Cambodia, India (dementedly, the parents actually believed the kids would really like Varanasi, where Hindu pilgrims bring the bodies of their dead relatives to burned on massive pyres, the ashes tossed into the River Ganges), Nepal, the deserts of Jordan, Cairo, the soon-to-be seething streets of Jerusalem, and eventually Paris and London.\n12,000 Miles should inspire wanderlust in all those who ever have taken any sort of a journey, or even contemplated one, but this isn't really a travel book. It's not even an adventure travel book, though the Jacobsons certainly had some harrowing and mind-blowing encounters during their three months abroad. 12,000 Miles is about another kind of travel, about remembering who your family is and how you all got that way. It is about journeying through the often impersonal, frightening, dangerous universe with the people who, for better or worse, share your DNA, experiences, memories, and dreams. It is about the spaces that exist in between you and the people you love, how they sometimes grow too great, and how distances can be closed, simply by reaching out and taking the time to look at each other, sometimes in the most remote of locales. This is the story of an American family.\nA family comedy reminiscent of The Osbournes, Jacobson's odyssey is also a wider journey. A story about parenting-stretching across generations, an expedition into the minds of five family members as they make their way through a succession of cramped cars, 17-hour train rides, seemingly endless walks through teeming metropolises-and one more bowl of curry.\nFueled by Jacobson's trademark mix of candor and sincerity (and by his own daughter Rae's commentary, who has her say in a \"Talkback\" section) 12,000 Miles in the Nick of Time is a rollicking journey across the globe and a sincere attempt for Jacobson to make sense of his own existential position as: The Dad.","title_az":"12,000 Miles in the Nick of Time: A Semi-Dysfunctional Family Circumnavigates the Globe (An Evergreen book)","rank":2164372.0,"category":"Research&amp;PublishingGuides"},{"isbn":"1592980732","asin":null,"title_gr":"Listening Leaders: The Ten Golden Rules To Listen, Lead & Succeed","author_name":"Lyman K.

A poet and actress who had done occasional workshops at the correctional facility, Peterson was ill-prepared for a full-time stint teaching in the GED program for the incarcerated youths. For the first time faced with full days teaching the rambunctious, hyper, and fragile adolescent inmates, \"Ms. P\" comes to understand the essence of her predominantly Black and Latino students as she attempts not only to educate them, but to instill them with a sense of self-worth long stripped from their lives.\n\"I have quite a spirited group of drama kings, court jesters, flyboy gangsters, tricksters, and wannabe pimps all in my charge, all up in my face, to educate,\" Peterson discovers. \"Corralling this motley crew of bad-news bears to do any lesson is like running boot camp for hyperactive gremlins. I have to be consistent, alert, firm, witty, fearless, and demanding, and most important, I have to have strong command of the subject I'm teaching.\" Discipline is always a challenge, with the students spouting street-infused backtalk and often bouncing off the walls with pent-up testosterone. Peterson learns quickly that she must keep the upper hand-set the rules and enforce them with rigor, even when her sympathetic heart starts to waver.\nDespite their relentless bravura and antics-and in part because of it-Peterson becomes a fierce advocate for her students. She works to instill the young men, mostly black, with a sense of pride about their history and culture: from their African roots to Langston Hughes and Malcolm X. She encourages them to explore and express their true feelings by writing their own poems and essays. When the boys push her buttons (on an almost daily basis) she pushes back, demanding that they meet not only her expectations or the standards of the curriculum, but set expectations for themselves-something most of them have never before been asked to do. She witnesses some amazing successes as some of the boys come into their own under her tutelage.\nPeterson vividly captures the prison milieu and the exuberance of the kids who have been handed a raw deal by society and have become lost within the system. Her time in the classroom teaches her something, too-that these boys want to be rescued. They want normalcy and love and opportunity.","title_az":"All Day: A Year of Love and Survival Teaching Incarcerated Kids at Rikers Island","rank":476039.0,"category":"SocialSciences"},{"isbn":"1455568074","asin":null,"title_gr":"On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2)","author_name":"Alison Bliss","top_genre":"romance","publisher":"Forever","publication_year":2017.0,"format":"Mass Market Paperback","num_pages":297.0,"average_rating":3.87,"ratings_count":368.0,"text_reviews_count":144.0,"description":"The second book in a laugh-out-loud new contemporary romance series from Alison Bliss!\nBig girls don't cry.

This book documents the milestones in that hard won struggle and reflects on women's impact on politics since.\nFrom the birth of our nation to the recent crushing defeat of the first female presidential candidate, this book highlights women's impact on United States politics and government. It documents the fight for women's right to vote, drawing on historic research, biographies of leaders, and such original sources as photos, line art, charts, graphs, documents, posters, ads, and buttons. It presents this often-forgotten struggle in an accessible, conversational, relevant manner for a wide audience. Here are the groundbreaking convention records, speeches, newspaper accounts, letters, photos, and drawings of those who fought for women's right to vote, all in their own words, arranged to convey the inherent historical drama. The accessible almanac style allows this entertaining history speak for itself. It is full of little-known facts. For instance: When the Constitutional Convention of the thirteen colonies convened to draft the Constitution, Abigail Adams admonished her husband John Adams to \"remember the ladies\" (write rights for women into the Constitution!).

One of the first cities in the United States to experience the ravages of deindustrialization, it was also among the first places in the world to turn to its own industrial and ethnic history as a tool for reinventing itself in the emerging postindustrial economy. The Lowell Experiment explores how history and culture have been used to remake Lowell and how historians have played a crucial yet ambiguous role in that process.\nThe book focuses on Lowell National Historical Park, the flagship project of Lowell's new cultural economy. When it was created in 1978, the park broke new ground with its sweeping reinterpretations of labor, immigrant, and women's history. It served as a test site for the ideas of practitioners in the new field of public history -- a field that links the work of professionally trained historians with many different kinds of projects in the public realm.\nThe Lowell Experiment takes an anthropological approach to public history in Lowell, showing it as a complex cultural performance shaped by local memory, the imperatives of economic redevelopment, and tourist rituals -- all serving to locate the park's audiences and workers more securely within a changing and uncertain new economy characterized by growing inequalities and new exclusions.\nThe paradoxical dual role of Lowell's public historians as both interpreters of and contributors to that new economy raises important questions about the challenges and limitations facing academically trained scholars in contemporary American culture. As a long-standing and well-known example of \"culture-led re-development,\" Lowell offers an outstanding site for exploring questions of concern to those in the fields of public and urban history, urban planning, and tourism studies.","title_az":"The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City","rank":914020.0,"category":"Americas"},{"isbn":"0722537735","asin":null,"title_gr":"The Way of Love","author_name":"Nigel Watts","top_genre":"passed-along-no-longer-own","publisher":null,"publication_year":null,"format":null,"num_pages":null,"average_rating":4.18,"ratings_count":57.0,"text_reviews_count":6.0,"description":null,"title_az":"The Way of Love","rank":1957251.0,"category":"Contemporary"},{"isbn":"1927685222","asin":null,"title_gr":"Cave Walker","author_name":"Donelle N.

Sandra is a dancer in the corps of the New York City Ballet who has just caught George Balanchine's eye. Adam is an explosively gifted new star who has defected to the rival company, the American Ballet Theatre. They are in love, passionate and ambitious, but ill-prepared to handle the demands, seductions, and expectations that are visited on them as they come within reach of their dreams.\nThe novel picks up where ballet history has left off: Since the beginning of his career, Balanchine sought to create an opulent ballet from the fairy tale \"The Sleeping Beauty,\" but never had the means and the muse come together at the same time. In First Love, Adrienne Sharp conjures in Sandra a last muse for the ailing ballet master. She has toiled invisibly in the corps for years, fearing that her moment to emerge as a principal dancer will pass unnoticed. Balanchine changes all that when he promises that he will make Sleeping Beautyfor her, and that it will be his final and greatest ballet. But his favor comes at a price, and Sandra is forced to decide which of her loves comes first. Should she continue her tumultuous involvement with the first boy to capture her heart, and succumb to his vision of their future? Or should she accept all that Balanchine offers--the fulfillment of a dream nurtured from childhood?\nAdrienne Sharpe is a former ballet dancer herself, and her first book, the acclaimed short-story collection White Swan, Black Swan, a national bestseller, was praised by John Casey as \"a stunningly lovely book about dance and dancers...brilliantly clear, dramatically swift, and knowingly conceived.\" Sharp's debut novel features the same marvelous storytelling as it revisits the vivid and rarefied world of dancers, and the sacrifices and hard bargains they make in pursuit of beauty, grace, and consummate passion.","title_az":"First Love","rank":4770293.0,"category":"UnitedStates"},{"isbn":"1496708326","asin":null,"title_gr":"Firefly Cove","author_name":"Davis Bunn","top_genre":"giveaways","publisher":"Kensington Publishing Corporation","publication_year":2017.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":320.0,"average_rating":5.0,"ratings_count":1.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"From the internationally bestselling author of Miramar Baycomes a deeply emotional novel that explores the challenges of living, the joys of loving, and the bittersweet act of letting go . . .\nI have this, Lucius thought to himself.

Looking for a new world to call their own, they brought with them a rich melange of cultures, religions, and dialects from a far-off planet called Earth. Mighty were the old-fathers, with the power to shape the world to their liking--but that was many generations ago, and what was once known has long been lost. Steamboats and gas-filled blimps now traverse the planet, where people once looked up to see great silver cities in the sky.\nLike his world, John deBrun has forgotten more than he remembers. Twenty-seven years ago, he washed up onto the shore of Nanagada with no memory of his past. Although he has made a new life for himself among the peaceful islanders, his soul remains haunted by unanswered questions about his own identity.\nThese mysteries take on new urgency when the fearsome Azteca storm over the Wicked High Mountains in search of fresh blood and hearts to feed their cruel, inhuman gods.

To defend Earth (a target for our new enemies, should we let them get close enough) and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has gone on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.\nEarth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force, which shields the home planet from too much knowledge of the situation. What's known to everybody is that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve your time at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.\nJohn Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect.

For five long years, thousands of men and women fought ferociously in the coldest corner of hell on earth. Some fought for survival, some struggled to help others survive, and some sought to crush their enemies. If man-made death didn't get you, the Arctic's weapons of ice and cold would. These natural weapons killed regardless of whose side you were on or how just was your cause. No one escaped unscathed. Author Mike Walling captures the Arctic convoys' bitter essence in Forgotten Sacrifice.\nThe story launches in October 1939, when Germany and the Soviet Union began diplomatic maneuvering. The action accelerates with Winston Churchill's decision in 1941 to provide supplies to Soviet forces battling the German invasion. From this point until the closing days of WWII in spring 1945, an unremitting sea battle raged within the confines of the always-lethal, ever-shifting Arctic ice pack and the savage Scandinavian coastline. Nearly 4.5 million tons of supplies were moved in 77 convoys over the course of 5 years in order to help the Soviet war effort. The Allies fought to keep the sea lanes open to Murmansk while the Germans were determined to slaughter every ship which dared to make the attempt. By the end of the convoys, 98 ships had been lost.

You may know him as the lead guitarist in Def Leppard, whose signature song \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" is still as widely enjoyed as when it debuted in 1988. Maybe you've heard of him as the rock star who gave up alcohol and meat more than twenty-five years ago. Most likely you've seen him shirtless--in photos or in real life--flaunting his impeccably toned body to appreciative female fans.\nBut it wasn't always like this. Collen worked his way up from nothing, teaching himself guitar from scratch as a teenager by imitating his heroes. He slogged it out in London-based pub bands for years, long before Def Leppard formed and transformed from unknowns to icons (all thanks to a little album called Pyromania), from playing openers in near-empty arenas to headlining in those same stadiums and selling them out every night. But as Collen discovered, true overnight success is a myth. Like the other band members, he had to struggle and fight his way to the top; in the end, he says, \"our work ethic saved us.\" Just as it still does.\nThis is Collen's story, starting with his first real taste of success and wild rock and roll excess as a member of the seminal glam rock outfit Girl. But once he joins Def Leppard, it's also an amazing underdog tale featuring a bunch of ordinary working-class lads who rose to mega-stardom, overcoming incredible obstacles--such as drummer Rick Allen losing an arm in a car crash and the tragic death of guitarist Steve Clark, Phil's musical soul mate, who lost his fight with alcoholism. Featuring personal, never-before-seen photos of Collen and his band mates on stage and off, Adrenalized is a fascinating account of the failures, triumphs, challenges, and rock-hard dedication it takes to make dreams come true.","title_az":"Adrenalized: Life, Def Leppard, and Beyond","rank":307647.0,"category":"Music"},{"isbn":"0689859058","asin":null,"title_gr":"Hard Cash (Hard Cash Trilogy, #1)","author_name":"Kate Cann","top_genre":"young-adult","publisher":"Simon Pulse","publication_year":2003.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":327.0,"average_rating":3.58,"ratings_count":307.0,"text_reviews_count":12.0,"description":"\"Easy Money\" Rich is sick of being broke.

Nothing is forgotten; everything returns in time. Ke'argis is summoned to a birth in the village of Sedryn, and he is ill prepared for the event. Born with magic in his blood, the babe becomes the focal point for ancient and terrible forces beyond the knowledge or ability of Ke'argis. His protective wards cannot hold back the flood of magic rushing to claim the baby's mind and body. In a desperate final act, Ke'argis saves the child and flees into the mountains. Adopting the boy as his own, Ke'argis labors to protect and teach young Sedrik about magic... but the child's unquenchable power threatens not only the village, but the precarious peace established after the last cataclysm. Nine hundred years before the boy's birth, the eighth cataclysm shook the world and threw down civilization. In its aftermath, human wizards swore to keep magic a secret, locked away and taught only to a certain few, chosen to protect mankind from the influence of magic itself. The power of magic could no longer be trusted in the hands of humanity. As Sedrik ages, magic is drawn to him; the ability to call upon arcane symbols endangers Sedrik and everyone around him. Ke'argis seeks shelter in an ancient place. Yet even there the boy cannot escape the call of magic. Driven from the sanctuary, Sedrik flees. Ke'argis vows to pursue him to the ends of the world; he vows to save his son from the burden laid upon him. Others are watching young Sedrik, as well. The Elves will not allow humans to gain the power once wielded--power which brought ruin to all. Yet the Elves bear a dark secret and it may determine the course of Ke'argis, Sedrik, and magic itself. Events are in motion, driven on by the memories carried in the flow of magic. ... ... ... \"Warding the Magic\" is the first full-length story set in the world of Myrmidya.

Born into slavery, mulatto Elizabeth Keckly was Mary Lincoln's dressmaker, confidante, and mainstay during the difficult years that the Lincolns occupied the White House and the early years of Mary's widowhood. But she was a fascinating woman in her own right, independent and already well-established as the dressmaker to the Washington elite when she was first hired by Mary Lincoln upon her arrival in the nation's capital. Lizzy had bought her freedom in 1855 and come to Washington determined to make a life for herself as a free black, and she soon had Washington correspondents reporting that \"stately carriages stand before her door, whose haughty owners sit before Lizzy docile as lambs while she tells them what to wear.\" Mary Lincoln had hired Lizzy in part because she was considered a \"high society\" seamstress and Mary, an outsider in Washington's social circles, was desperate for social cachet. With her husband struggling to keep the nation together, Mary turned increasingly to her seamstress for companionship, support, and advice--and over the course of those trying years, Lizzy Keckly became her confidante and closest friend.\nWith \"Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly,\" pioneering historian Jennifer Fleischner allows us to glimpse the intimate dynamics of this unusual friendship for the first time, and traces the pivotal events that enabled these two women--one born to be a mistress, the other to be a slave--to forge such an unlikely bond at a time when relations between blacks and whites were tearing the nation apart. Beginning with their respective childhoods in the slaveholding states of Virginia and Kentucky, their story takes us through the years of tragic Civil War, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the early Reconstruction period. An author in her own right, Keckly wrote one of the most detailed biographies of Mary Lincoln ever published, and though it led to a bitter feud between the friends, it is one of the many rich resources that have enhanced Fleischner's trove of original findings.\nA remarkable, riveting work of scholarship that reveals the legacy of slavery and sheds new light on the Lincoln White House, Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Kecklybrings to life a mesmerizing, intimate aspect of Civil War history, and underscores the inseparability of black and white in our nation's heritage.","title_az":"Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly: The Remarkable Story of the Friendship Between a First Lady and a Former Slave","rank":1047757.0,"category":"Americas"},{"isbn":"0785158693","asin":null,"title_gr":"Marvel Masterworks: The Uncanny X-Men, Vol. 4","author_name":"Chris Claremont","top_genre":"comics","publisher":"Marvel","publication_year":2012.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":232.0,"average_rating":4.11,"ratings_count":66.0,"text_reviews_count":8.0,"description":"Chris Claremont, Dave Cockrum and John Byrne took a little reprint series called X-MEN and turned it into the all-new, all-different titan that conquered comicdom.

But as life comes full circle and a resurrection of Broadway and midtown Manhattan begins, Vera and her children may be able to rise from the depths of despair and breathe life back into their dreams.\nLights is a poignant, sweeping story of revival as a Broadway actress attempts to restore her hope, faith, and separate destinies for her family while living in a city marked by hate, ignorance, and poverty.","title_az":"Lights: Despair, Faith, and Hope on Broadway","rank":7804273.0,"category":"GenreFiction"},{"isbn":"0425158365","asin":null,"title_gr":"Armored Cav: A Guided Tour of an Armored Cavalry Regiment","author_name":"Tom Clancy","top_genre":"military","publisher":"Berkley","publication_year":1994.0,"format":"Trade Paperback","num_pages":325.0,"average_rating":3.7,"ratings_count":772.0,"text_reviews_count":14.0,"description":"A penetrating look inside an armored cavalry regiment -- the technology, the strategies, and the people . . . profiled by Tom Clancy.\nHis first non-fiction book, Submarine, captured the reality of life aboard a nuclear warship.

Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Presentaccompanies an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art that documents approximately 50 of the artist's ephemeral time- and media-based works from throughout her career. The book also discusses a unique element of the Museum's retrospective, live performance: a new work created for the occasion, and performed by Abramovic herself; and re-creations of the artist's works by other performers-the first such to be undertaken in a museum setting. The book spans over four decades of Abramovic's early interventions and sound pieces, video works, installations, photographs, solo performances and collaborative performances made with the Dutch artist Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen). Essays by Klaus Biesenbach, Chief Curator of Media and performance art at MoMA, and four distinguished scholars examine Abramovic's ideas of time, duration and the reperformance of performance art as a way to extend it into posterity. The Artist Is Presentalso includes a CD with audio commentary by the artist that guides the reader through the publication. The artist is present not only in the exhibition but also in the experience of the book.Born in Belgrade just after the end of the Second World War, Marina Abramovic was raised in the Serbian Orthodox Church (her great uncle was a Patriarch and a canonized saint in the Church) and left Yugoslavia in 1976, having already established herself as a performance artist, living in Amsterdam and eventually New York, where she presently lives.","title_az":"Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present","rank":947793.0,"category":"IndividualArtists"},{"isbn":"1453845585","asin":null,"title_gr":"Deeper into the Void","author_name":"Mitchell A.

The prevalence of blood in the social, juridical, and political organization of the modern West signals that we do not live in a secular age into which religion could return. Flowing across multiple boundaries, infusing them with violent precepts that we must address, blood undoes the presumed oppositions between religion and politics, economy and theology, and kinship and race.

She began a diary that she would continue to write for the next forty years and compile later in life, bringing lasting prestige to her family.\nSome aspects of the author's life and text seem curiously modern. She married at age thirty-three and identified herself as a reader and writer more than as a wife and mother. Enthralled by romantic fiction, she wrote extensively about the disillusioning blows that reality can deal to fantasy. The Sarashina Diaryis a portrait of the writer as reader and an exploration of the power of reading to shape one's expectations and aspirations.\nAs a person and an author, this writer presages the medieval era in Japan with her deep concern for Buddhist belief and practice. Her narrative's main thread follows a trajectory from youthful infatuation with romantic fantasy to the disillusionment of age and concern for the afterlife; yet, at the same time, many passages erase the dichotomy between literary illusion and spiritual truth. This new translation captures the lyrical richness of the original text while revealing its subtle structure and ironic meaning. The introduction highlights the poetry in the Sarashina Diaryand the juxtaposition of poetic passages and narrative prose, which brings meta-meanings into play. The translators' commentary offers insight into the author's family and world, as well as the fascinating textual legacy of her work.","title_az":"The Sarashina Diary: A Woman's Life in Eleventh-Century Japan (Translations from the Asian Classics)","rank":1315746.0,"category":"History&amp;Criticism"},{"isbn":"1844096076","asin":null,"title_gr":"Making Art a Practice: How to Be the Artist You Are","author_name":"Cat Bennett","top_genre":"art","publisher":"Findhorn Press","publication_year":2013.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":128.0,"average_rating":3.94,"ratings_count":91.0,"text_reviews_count":20.0,"description":"Helping artists catapult into further action, this guide is a treasury of insight and inspiration.

She had it all: a loving husband who worked on Wall Street, two beautiful, healthy sons, and a dream home in the affluent Long Island community where she grew up, surrounded by friends and family. But then, with one phone call, the life she knew and loved came crashing down around her. \"Your husband,\" the caller said, \"is in custody for a series of bank robberies that have occurred all over Nassau County.\" Jeanne would soon discover that her husband, Stephen, was living a lie. He was no longer the Wall Street trader that Jeanne, his family, and his friends all thought him to be. Instead of heading to Wall Street each morning as he claimed, Stephen was robbing banks. In Disguised Blessings, Jeanne chronicles the human toll of this ripped-from-the-headlines true story. Consumed by anger and humiliation and faced with mounting debt and piles of unpaid bills, Jeanne entered what she describes as the \"darkest time\" in her life. But Jeanne's story is not a tragedy; it is a story of hope and redemption, of faith, love, and the power of forgiveness. With heart-wrenching candor, Jeanne describes how, with the generosity of friends and family and the unconditional love of her two boys, she was able to put the broken pieces of her life back together, in the end discovering that from tragedy can come Disguised Blessings.","title_az":"Disguised Blessings: A wife's story of her Wall Street husband turned bank robber","rank":2274554.0,"category":"Biographies&amp;Memoirs"},{"isbn":"0451112040","asin":null,"title_gr":"Sisters","author_name":"Lynne Cheney","top_genre":"bodice-ripper","publisher":"Signet","publication_year":1981.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":215.0,"average_rating":2.92,"ratings_count":12.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"From Lynne Cheney, the wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, comes a riveting tale of women in the American frontier.\nThe novel of a strong and beautiful woman who broke all the rules of the American frontier...\nSophie Dymond had overcome nineteenth-century prejudices to succeed as publisher of a hugely popular women's magazine. But when she left New York to revisit her native Wyoming, where her sister had died mysteriously, she left her prestige and power far behind. Waiting for Sophie was a world where women were treated either as decorative figurines or as abject sexual vassals...where wives were led to despise the marriage act and prostitutes pandered to husbands' hungers...where the relationship between women and men became a kind of guerilla warfare in which women were forced to band together for the strength they needed and at times for the love they wanted.

Our light-speed economy has made possible a new American dream, to take an idea overnight from the kitchen table to hundreds of millions of dollars in market value. But the desperate Internet entrepreneur knows every day, every night-- that the chances of success and survival dwindle at the same rate as the cash evaporates. Make the right deals, announce the right products at the right time, and the investors will beat down your doors with money. Falter, and the venture capitalists will eat you alive. Michael Wolff was one of the first to see the potential of the Internet and one of the pioneers of new media. As he labored to build his own company, Wolff, a former journalist, knew he had stumbled on the seminal business story of the 1990s. \"Burn Rate\" is about the heart-in-your-throat struggles of being an entrepreneur. It is about witnessing an industry being born: the founding of Wired magazine, the launch of Time Warner's much-touted Pathfinder, the conflict between content centered on the East Coast and technology on the West Coast, the rise of the search engines, the dominance and dysfunctionality of America Online, and the thud of Microsoft stumbling and falling down on the Net.\nIn the precarious world of the Internet, where income is a rosy projection and profit little more than a hope and a prayer, a company is no better than the confidence it radiates to its potential partners. After the freewheeling early years of the World Wide Web, the financial prospects of fledgling Web businesses collectively dropped in one stunning month when Wired, the most famous Internet company, failed to launch its stock. Wolff found himself at the head of a rapidly expanding company with seven weeks of capital remaining, trapped between the insatiable needs of his business and the chilling machinations of his investors. With the clock ticking, his only hope was to strike a winning deal.\nWith mordant wit, \"Burn Rate\" portrays life on the bleeding edge of capitalism-- a realm where your savior, the venture capitalist, may also be your undoing. A Faustian figure, the venture capitalist reveals to Michael Wolff the secret workings of business, as well as the human dimensions of how companies are made, bought, and sold. But the price he asks in return is steep. He never risks too much of his own money but makes sure that he will profit best and first from the entrepreneur's work.\nAs Wolff builds his business, you'll get to know the geeks, billionaires, weasels, and, of course, visionaries he meets along the way. Louis Rossetto, the unemployed expat who creates Wired. Walter Isaacson, the prince of Time Warner, who throws the resources of America's largest media company behind the Web. The boy investor, the \"dumb money\" who backs Wolff's company. Halsey Minor, the executive recruiter who founds a publishing empire on the Net. The CMP boys, the computer magazine publishers who are desperate to get into the Internet game. Robert Maxwell's children, whose high-flying company is one of the first bubbles to burst on the Internet. Even Barry Biller, who advises Wolff that getting in on the ground floor is good only if you're still standing in the end.\nWolff discovers, much to his own consternation, that his work, inspiration, and imagination entitle him to no more than a minor share of his own company's potential wealth. And, in the end, he may only be along for the ride.","title_az":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","rank":2583958.0,"category":"Professionals&amp;Academics"},{"isbn":"0008261334","asin":null,"title_gr":"Her Deadly Secret","author_name":"Chris Curran","top_genre":"netgalley","publisher":"Killer Reads","publication_year":2017.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":160.0,"average_rating":4.1,"ratings_count":2.0,"text_reviews_count":1.0,"description":"A FAMILY BUILT ON LIES...\nA dark and twisty psychological thriller, in which a young girl is abducted and her family is confronted with a horror from deep in their past.

Moved by his patients' valor in the face of death, seeking to comprehend the mysteries revealed at their bedside, Holt has taken up fiction again. He emerges now with this astonishing collection of one novella and seven short stories that explore the farthest reaches of the imagination in a style that recalls the nineteenth-century American masters.\nHolt leaps across genres and millennia, from small-town America to deep space, daring his readers to journey with him into realms as mysterious as they are unforgettable.

The final story, \"Apocalypse,\" returns to small-town New England and another vision of the end, in an intimate account of how a couple struggles to live and love under the shadow of the Earth's approaching doom. In between, these stories range from outer space, where--in \"Charybdis\"--an astronaut alone on a doomed NASA mission comes to terms with his fate, to the Egyptian desert of the title novella, where an archaeologist seeks a fabulous tomb that holds the secret of immortality.

He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this 'March Up-Country' (\"Anabasis\"); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth.\nXenophon's \"Anabasis\" is a true story of remarkable adventures. \"Hellenica, \" a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In \"Memorabilia\" Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The \"Apology\" is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's \"Symposium\" portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and \"Oeconomicus\" has him giving advice on household management and married life. \"Cyropaedia, \" a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes.\nWe also have his \"Hiero, \" a dialogue on government; \"Agesilaus, \" in praise of that king; \"Constitution of Lacedaemon\" (on the Spartan system); \"Ways and Means\" (on the finances of Athens); \"Manual for a Cavalry Commander;\" a good manual of \"Horsemanship;\" and a lively \"Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, \" though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.","title_az":"Xenophon VII (Hiero. Agesilaus. Constitution of the Lacedaemonians.

He's also close with an A - list television star who adores him. After a tawdry cover story in a popular celebrity tabloid, a spotlight illuminates the fact that Roman is the son of an indicted Mob kingpin, and therefore, heir presumptive to his father's vast criminal enterprise that commands the Tri-State area.\nZoe Greene is young, attractive and enjoying rave reviews in her role on The Prosecutor, a prime time network television series.

It was nothing less than a major political realignment, as the direction of federal policy shifted from conservative to liberal-and liberalism itself was redefined in the process. Electing FDR is the first book in seventy years to examine in its entirety the 1932 presidential election that ushered in the New Deal. Award-winning historian Donald Ritchie looks at how candidates responded to the nation's economic crisis and how voters evaluated their performance. More important, he explains how the Democratic Party rebuilt itself after three successive Republican landslides: where the major shifts in party affiliation took place, what contingencies contributed to FDR's victory, and why the new coalition persisted as long as it did. Ritchie challenges prevailing assumptions that the Depression made Roosevelt's election inevitable. He shows that FDR came close to losing the nomination to contenders who might have run to the right of Hoover, and discusses the role of newspapers and radio in presenting the candidates to voters. He also analyzes Roosevelt's campaign strategies, recounting his attempts to appeal to disaffected voters of all ideological stripes, often by altering his positions to broaden his popularity. With the advent of the New Deal, Americans came to enjoy a wide federal safety net that provided everything from old age pensions to rural electricity-government innovations so embraced by voters that even later conservative presidents recognized their importance. Ritchie traces this legacy through the Reagan and Bush years, but he relates how FDR in 1932 was often vague about the specifics of his program and questions whether voters really knew what they were in for with the New Deal. As pundits, politicians, and citizens eye the upcoming 2008 campaign, Electing FDR reminds incumbents not to take their party support for granted or to underestimate their opponents-and reminds students of history that understanding the New Deal begins with the 1932's transformative election.","title_az":"Electing FDR: The New Deal Campaign of 1932 (American Presidential Elections)","rank":1837552.0,"category":"Politics&amp;Government"},{"isbn":"0394527534","asin":null,"title_gr":"FDR: The New Deal Years 1933-1937","author_name":"Kenneth Sydney Davis","top_genre":"books-i-own","publisher":"Random House","publication_year":1995.0,"format":"Hardcover","num_pages":756.0,"average_rating":4.05,"ratings_count":19.0,"text_reviews_count":5.0,"description":"FDR: The War Presidentopens as Roosevelt has been re-elected to a third term and the United States is drifting toward a war that has already engulfed Europe. Roosevelt, as commander in chief, statesman, and politician, must navigate a delicate balance between helping those in Europe--while remaining mindful of the forces of isolation both in the Congress and the country--and protecting the gains of the New Deal, upon which he has spent so much of his prestige and power.\nKenneth S. Davis draws vivid depictions of the lives, characters, and temperaments of the military and political personalities so paramount to the history of the time: Churchill, Stalin, de Gaulle, and Hitler; Generals Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur; Admiral Darlan, Chiang Kai-shek, Charles Lindbergh, William Allen White, Joseph Kennedy, Averell Harriman, Harry Tru-man, Robert Murphy, Sidney Hillman, William Knud-sen, Cordell Hull, Henry Morgenthau, Henry Stimson, A. Philip Randolph, Wendell Willkie, and Henry Wallace.\nThe portrait of Henry Hopkins, who interacted with many of these personalities on behalf of Roosevelt, is woven into this history as the complex, interconnected relationship it was. Hopkins burnished the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt and eased the way for their interactions with Stalin.\nAnother set of characters central to Roosevelt's life and finely drawn by the author includes Eleanor Roo-sevelt, Sara Roosevelt, Missy LeHand, Grace Tully, Princess Martha of Norway, and Daisy Suckley.\nIntegral to this history as well are the Argentina Conference, the Atlantic Charter and the beginnings of the United Nations, the Moscow Conference, lend-lease, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, Hitler's Final Solution and how Roosevelt and the State Department reacted to it, Pearl Harbor and war with Japan, the planning of Torch, and the murder of Admiral Darlan. All these stories intersect with the economic and social problems facing Roosevelt at home as the United States mobilizes for war.\nThe lessons and concerns of 1940-1943 as dissected in this book are still relevant to the problems and concerns of our own time. A recurrent theme is technology: Do people control technology, or does technology control people?\nKenneth Davis had the rare gift of writing history that reads with the immediacy of a novel; and though the outcome of this history is well known, the events and people depicted here keep the reader focused on an enthralling suspense story.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","title_az":"FDR: The New Deal Years 1933-1937","rank":1799815.0,"category":"Leaders&NotablePeople"},{"isbn":"1941539033","asin":null,"title_gr":"Cannibal (Chess Team Adventure, #7)","author_name":"Jeremy Robinson","top_genre":"jeremy-robinson","publisher":"Breakneck Media","publication_year":2015.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":386.0,"average_rating":4.44,"ratings_count":11.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"Still recovering from the tragic loss of a good friend, Jack Sigler, callsign: King, leads the Chess Team--a crew of former Delta operators--back into action.

Gabriella's life has been filled with tragedy, including the mystery of why her own parents disappeared one night, leaving her alone at a tender young age. Soon after her husband dies, she and her son move to her childhood home--a house on a cliff by the sea in a village that time has left behind. It's there that she and some local villagers begin the process of bringing her parent's old orange grove back to life.\nAs Gabriella begins to put together the pieces of why her parents abandoned her, she soon learns they were victims of powerful forces that threatened to tear apart the quiet little village by the sea. And that knowledge, along with all the other losses she's experienced, causes Gabriella to view God with great suspicion and fear. So when her young son experiences a dramatic conversion and begins to serve Him, an all-out battle ensues.\nDuring this time, Gabriella often feels called to the edge of the cliff, torn between letting herself slip over it and ending the pain, or fighting for a happiness she's not even sure exists. Will Gabriella continue to do battle with God? Or will she come to have faith in the God she blames for all the tragedies she's suffered?\nAnd what role will her young son play in her decision?\nThis book considers questions like: What happens when God doesn't act like we think He should? And Can someone who has experienced so much pain and disappointment ever really let go of the hurt and learn to trust Him?\n>>>>Reader Reviews:\n\"Seriously....love it!!

Were McCarthy and McCarthyism the worst things to happen to American politics in the postwar era? Or was McCarthy just a well-intentioned politician who seized a legitimate issue with the fervor of a true believer?\nPerhaps something in between. For the first time, here is a biography of Joe McCarthy that cuts through the cliches and misconceptions surrounding this central figure of the \"red scare\" of the fifties, and reexamines his life and legacy in the, light of newly declassified archival sources from the FBI, the National Security Agency, the U.S. Congress, the Pentagon, and the former Soviet Union. After more than four decades, here is the untold story of America's most hated political figure, shorn of the rhetoric and stereotypes of the past.\n\"Joseph McCarthy\" explains how this farm boy from Wisconsin sprang up from a newly confident postwar America, and how he embodied the hopes and anxieties of a generation caught in the toils of the Cold War. It shows how McCarthy used the explosive issue of Communist spying in the thirties and forties to challenge the Washington political establishment and catapult himself into the headlines. Above all, it gives us a picture of the red scare far different from and more accurate than the one typically portrayed in the news media and the movies.\nWe now know that the Communist spying McCarthy fought against was amazingly extensive -- reaching to the highest levels of the White House and the top-secret Manhattan Project. Herman hasthe facts to show in detail which of McCarthy's famous anti-Communist investigations were on target (such as the notorious cases of Owen Lattimore and Irving Peress, the Army's \"pink dentist\") and which were not (including the case that led to McCarthy's final break with Whittaker Chambers). When McCarthy accused two American employees of the United Nations of being Communists, he was widely criticized -- but he was right. When McCarthy called Owen Lattimore \"Moscow's top spy,\" he was again assailed -- but we now know Lattimore was a witting aid to Soviet espionage networks. McCarthy often overreached himself. \"But McCarthy was often right.\"\nIn \"Joseph McCarthy,\" Arthur Herman reveals the human drama of a fascinating, troubled, and self-destructive man who was often more right than wrong, and yet in the end did more harm than good.","title_az":"Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator","rank":183781.0,"category":"Historical"},{"isbn":"0470184035","asin":null,"title_gr":"Frommer's Morocco","author_name":"Darren Humphrys","top_genre":"travel","publisher":"Frommer's","publication_year":2008.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":436.0,"average_rating":4.5,"ratings_count":5.0,"text_reviews_count":2.0,"description":"Frommer's.

Knox is asking what really matters, in poems that move powerfully toward an answer.\" www.jenniferlknox.com.","title_az":"The Mystery of the Hidden Driveway","rank":2369635.0,"category":"Poetry"},{"isbn":"0971267650","asin":null,"title_gr":"Never Night","author_name":"Derick Burleson","top_genre":"poetry","publisher":"Marick Press","publication_year":2008.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":72.0,"average_rating":4.71,"ratings_count":17.0,"text_reviews_count":3.0,"description":"Poetry. \"Should we have stayed at home, wherever that may be?\" a traveler writes in a notebook at the end of Elizabeth Bishop's \"Questions of Travel.\" The poems in NEVER NIGHT ask the same question as they travel textual geographies from wheat farm to boreal forest, from a cave become fallout shelter to a spy satellite's view of a wrecked oil tanker, from a gold mine's tailings to a child burying a dead guinea pig. Whether investigating a derailed train, a two-headed moose fetus or a melting glacier, these poems reveal wounded earth giving birth to shimmering form, death held at bay without artifice in the meditations of a child's new words. \"NEVER NIGHT is a hymn to life, a meditation on day and night, on the seasons, on nature and on love.

That's what Jennifer Davis's older children wanted to know while she was expecting the younger. So to explain, she wrote BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, now with 102,000 copies in print, a joyful lift-the-flap book that tells the parallel story of mother and baby during the nine months of pregnancy. Illustrated with full-color whimsy by Laura Cornell, whose delightful work is familiar to readers of Jamie Lee Curtis's Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born and When I Was Little, BEFORE YOU WERE BORN is a month-by-month countdown written in rhyming verse.\nEach page shows what's happening to the mother on the outside and then, under the flap, in the mother's belly to the baby on the inside. Children learn how Mommy is feeling and how the baby is developing, about hiccups, kicks, and umbilical cords, a first heartbeat, and the contractions that mark the beginning of labor.\nFor expectant mothers and curious little kids, and especially for kids with siblings on the way, it is an interactive storybook that delivers delight and information and reassurance, too.","title_az":"Before You Were Born","rank":257217.0,"category":"GrowingUp&amp;FactsofLife"},{"isbn":"1844163881","asin":null,"title_gr":"Sons of Fenris","author_name":"Lee Lightner","top_genre":"warhammer-40k","publisher":"Black Library","publication_year":2007.0,"format":"Paperback","num_pages":404.0,"average_rating":3.89,"ratings_count":508.0,"text_reviews_count":11.0,"description":"Ragnar and the Wolfblade are sent to investigate reports of Chaos attacks on the planet Hyades.

One could be forgiven for thinking that we are in far more danger today than ever before. The fact of the matter is that danger has always stalked mankind. From ancient volcanoes and floods to the cholera and small pox, to Hitler and Stalin's genocidal murders during the twentieth century, our continued existence has always seemed perilous. Now, out of our horror comes an entertaining and epic journal through the history of disaster. Disaster offers perspective on today's fears by revealing how dangerous our world has always been. Natural disasters and man-made catastrophes mark every era. Here is the Black Death that killed seventy-five million in Europe and Asia during the 1300s; the 1883 volcanic eruption on Krakatoa; the Irish potato famine of the mid-nineteenth century; the Nazi Holocaust; the 1970 storm in Bangladesh, now considered the deadliest in history; and more. Train crashes, air disasters, and shipwrecks litter human history.

The accident, which at first appears to be quite run-of-the-mill, turns out to be anything but. Since Jake is not willing to pretend there are no suspicious circumstances and more than the usual share of rather unlikely \"coincidences,\" he sets off a veritable avalanche of secrets, violence and treachery. Aided by an unlikely partner, Gregg Kaplan, the air traffic controller who was the last person in contact with the airplane that crashed, Jake sets out to untangle the webs of deceit and to find a vicious killer.\nNothing is as it seems, nobody is who you thought them to be.\nNothing is sacred.\nNobody is safe.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Chuck Barrett, a Florida native, grew up in Panama City. A graduate of Auburn University, Barrett is a retired air traffic controller of over 26 years experience and veteran commercial pilot and flight instructor spanning over three decades of flight experience.

The audience of about 100 listened with rapt attention as Chambers described results from a computer study of how planetary systems form. The goal of his research was to answer a dec- tively simple question: How often would newly forming planetary systems produce Earth-like planets, given a star the size of our own sun? By \"Ear- like\" Chambers meant a rocky planet with water on its surface, orbiting within a star's \"habitable zone. \" This not-too-hot and not-too-cold inner - gion, relatively close to the star, supports the presence of liquid water on a planet surface for hundreds of million of years--the time-span probably n- essary for the evolution of life. To answer the question of just how many Earth-like planets might be spawned in such a planetary system, Chambers had spent thousands of hours running highly sophisticated modeling p- grams through arrays of powerful computers. x Preface to the Paperback Edition The results presented at the meeting were startling. The simulations showed that rocky planets orbiting at the \"right\" distances from the central star are easily formed, but they can end up with a wide range of water c- tent.","title_az":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","rank":165364.0,"category":"Astronomy&amp;SpaceScience"}]
