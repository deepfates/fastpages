### I am one of those weird people you find on the internet. I [write](index/#writing), [design](index/#bots) and [code](index/#code).

This is my living notebook.

Living notebook, like a wizard would have: a book of arcane knowledge and experimental spells, a book that is forever changing and upgrading itself; a notebook that lives. 

But also a living notebook, analogous to a “living room”: a notebook that I live in. A place where I spend my time. 

And, too, a notebook On Living. Notes from someone who lives.
