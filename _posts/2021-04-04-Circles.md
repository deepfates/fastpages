I made a dataset of circles. I could not get a GAN to train on them at the time, but I went to all the trouble to align them,
so I decided I would make a movie. I think this is okay, because they are inherently contained.

**Warning: I still don't know what happens if you stare at this for too long! Use at your own risk.**
