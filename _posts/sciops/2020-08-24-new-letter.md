 It's been a while since I wrote this letter.
   

  

 That's for a lot of reasons, some of which are listed below. I'm in a liminal place in my life and I need to unfuck my head for a while. I'm sure I'll regain the confidence to try to explain the whole world. Sooner or later.
   

  

 In the meantime, I'm working on a new letter. It's called
 *Augmented Intelligence* 
 , and it's about a much smaller subject: interfaces. If you like SCIOPS, you'll probably like this. You can find it at
 [robotface.substack.com](https://robotface.substack.com) 
 .
   


It's in response to a challenge by an internet acquaintance. I'm highly responsive to peer pressure, so it'll probably even come out weekly!
  

  

If you're curious what happened to SCIOPS, I wrote some thoughts about it on Twitter. Reprinted here for posterity(ish):



 I have functionally stopped writing my newsletter, though I have not told anyone that it is over
 





 why is this? because podcasting is easier than writing? because covid apocalypse makes apocalypse newsletter obsolete? because I‚Äôm not confident enough in my worldview to share anymore?
 





 I‚Äôve begin to kind of hate newsletters, perhaps. I get a lot of them, was tipped off early to Republic of Newsletters. there are too many, now, and the vibe has changed
 





 One long-time writer, has turned his formerly-interesting letter into an occasional screed blasting everyone who‚Äôs not as woke.
 





 He‚Äôs not wrong, even. Just‚Ä¶ angry, and long-winded, and self-righteous.
 





 I‚Äôm afraid SCIOPS has gone the same way. I don‚Äôt want to be that guy
   

 When I started writing it, I wanted to be an expert. It‚Äôs hilarious, looking back, because the style was so unsophisticated. This is why ‚ÄúMedium posts‚Äù are so cheesy: they‚Äôre the enthusiastic raving of the neophyte.
 





 I wanted to be Your Guide to the Cyberpunk Apocalypse. How absurd: can you imagine how annoying that person would be? The guy who keeps pointing out ‚Äúthat‚Äôs an advertisement, see, they control your mind through the pattern of lights and sounds, they‚Äôre targeting you by your data‚Äù
 





 then for a while I was trying to keep up with the News Cycle. trying to ride the cryptocurrency wave the right way (take the money and the good ideas and run) instead of getting caught in the tulip bubble. it worked for me, although not in a big enough way to last üôÑ
 





 finally it settled into a monologue, bouncing between sermon and comedy, following my erratic mood.
 





 I felt a pattern emerge: 1000 words is enough to give an introduction to a topic, but not enough to dive deep. yet how can I expect someone to read an email longer than that?
 





 I don‚Äôt have the mad-dog vigor of the investigative journalist. I don‚Äôt have the STS degree or the SV friends to demand academic respect for my thoughts. I‚Äôm just another internet weirdo trying to make sense of the world.
 





 basically a street maniac with End of Days sign
 





 I don‚Äôt want to be an expert, actually. I don‚Äôt want to be a preacher. I barely want to be a writer ‚Äì such a limited bandwidth medium! (he said, on Twitter)
 





 I do have a useful worldview. I want to share it. but it works because I‚Äôm still learning. ‚Äúa foolish consistency‚Äù‚Ä¶
 





 I think the topical nature of the ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù is the culprit.
 





 ‚Äúa newsletter? what‚Äôs it about?‚Äù
 





 substack exacerbated this by commoditizing the newsletter. the decision to subscribe was based no longer on ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù but ‚Äúwhat does your product do for me?‚Äù
 





 on Twitter you follow
 

*people* 
 , not topics. the topics arise from the interaction of the people.
 





 not that I‚Äôm a huge fan of Discourse. but it‚Äôs certainly more rewarding than writing an essay, putting a stamp on it, then dropping it into a sinkhole and waiting for a response
 





 more immediately rewarding, anyway. obviously a heap of essays is more satisfying to look back on than a bunch of replies and threads and snarky QTs
   

 alternative explanations abound, though.
 





 Twitter has me locked in a dopamine loop, maybe, and I can‚Äôt get long form thoughts together without the instant boost of hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù on each paragraph
   

 maybe it‚Äôs just because I have a steady, healthy relationship with someone who will listen to me rant and joke and sermonize all day.
 





 a conspiracy to stop my writing, orchestrated by Big GF
 





 or
 





 the topic of SCIOPS (namely, psyops) is now actually the content of psyops produced by actual PSYOPS teams. infectious conspiracy brain is a tool of the conspiracies of control, to make it seem as if they‚Äôre more powerful than they are, and to muddy the waters on other ops
 





 a conspiracy against me, manufactured by Big Conspiracy
 





 conspiracy-industrial complex
 





 because SCIOPS is about dark wizards fucking with your mind, and because so many minds are infected with different exotoxic memes, I end up having to talk vaguely about the mental atmosphere, rather than digging into specific brainworms
 





 and because SCIOPS is ‚Äúabout something‚Äù, i have refrained from writhing the things that it‚Äôs not about. like the last two years I spent founding a bookstore in my hometown. or the bizarre code experiments I cook up on the weekends. I should have been documenting those
 




Thank you, all, for reading all these years. I'll be back.
