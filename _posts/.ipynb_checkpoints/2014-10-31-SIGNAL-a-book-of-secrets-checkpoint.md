## I trained a GAN on SIGNAL

In 2021 I used the raw images from SIGNAL to train a generative adversarial network, or GAN, to generate in-between images of the pages. It was one of my first experiments with GANs and wasn't very good, but I posted a tweet with a video of the training process.

That tweet went semi-viral: over 1,200 likes and hundreds of retweets, huge for roughly 800-follower account at the time. any people accused me of summoning "cyberdemons", which is apparently a thing from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and also maybe the video game DOOM.

This proved my memetic engineering thesis to my satisfaction, but it also drew unwanted attention from Twitter users and... other entities. So I deleted it.

The following sample has been selected for its relative safety. Nonetheless, please exercise caution when viewing it, especially for long periods.
