<font size="5">if there such thing as "the power of belief" — if there are things that don't work unless you believe in them, like faith healing or astrology — why don't people optimize their ability to believe in things arbitrarily?   where are all the successful faith users?</font>

<font size="5">exponential technological growth is limited by allocation of resources to R&amp;D, not by possible combinations.   this reminds me of a campfire: that's always enough oxygen nearby, but the surface area that touches air can only grow so fast  https://t.co/zD0Q2irZfo</font>

<font size="5">Twitter is actually hiding deleted replies from my notifications after I click through them. So I can't screenshot once I know it's deleted. This is bad development for internet history</font>

<font size="5">I like how everyone has taken this as some sort of argument against belief. I literally don't care what you think about the power of belief. I was looking for like a list of people</font>

<font size="5">the definition of "successful" is something like "directs large amounts of human coordination in the form of money or power toward their values".   For those of you who are less familiar with rationalist writing, here's the original post I was riffing on   https://t.co/OewGDCZf50</font>

<font size="5">doing one big life pivoting move, or even two, via faith is impressive. I'm interested in hearing of people who pivoted their beliefs several times and kept becoming more successful.   is it possible to do faith as systematized winning?   https://t.co/qzdWkVH8Nf</font>

<font size="5">so apparently you can buy a special icon for a hashtag, like #bitcoin or #tether or #eternals  This part of Twitter could probably crowdfund the necessary amount of money. What hashtag should we pick?</font>

<font size="5">it's true. I'm really good at believing things, that's why I've been caught in so many cults. And basically anytime I read nonfiction I think that it's complete true until I read something else and then I forget about it.  could I be a great astrologer?   https://t.co/6SP8oK7Q1r</font>
