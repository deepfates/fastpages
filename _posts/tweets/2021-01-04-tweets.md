<font size="5">if you're not on linux but you need an emoji picker, there's similar functionality built in to Windows and Mac.  Windows: hold Ctrl and press either . or ; Mac: hold Ctrl and Cmd and press Spacebar  why do they hide this from you? because they hate you, of course</font>

<font size="5">I just realized that Neal Stephenson writes all his books in Emacs Org-mode.  he's admitted being an emacser, he wrote a whole essay about it! he refuses to use social media, he's literally a greybeard  and his books Feel like infinitely expandable lists of bullet points..</font>

<font size="5">the essay is about more than Emacs (it is, like all his work, about Everything)  but it is certainly also written in Org-mode  a uniquely umami piece of technology writing. singlehandedly conviced me to try Linux as a teenager.   https://t.co/EfeaYlV6a8</font>

<font size="5">weird. the first part of this essay is an Emacs debug log, fine, 🆗  the second part is a breakdown of the values of text editors in general and how to fix Emacs in specific. 🔥  the third part is... regurgitated TED talks? 😮‍💨  also it's 15,000 words   https://t.co/65LUihTUXb</font>
