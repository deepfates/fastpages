<font size="5">I found an old repo that seems to generate sentient magic items for Pathfinder. Tested it out, thinking "did i write this? or just fork it from somewhere..."  I definitely wrote this  https://t.co/Y04pvdSJPb</font>

<font size="5">why is VS Code so much harder to theme than Atom? ther were so many experimental themes for Atom and in Code it's like.. different color menu bar. whoopee</font>

<font size="5">i didn't use all of the really goofy ones but it was fun that you could at least try. but i really liked "slightly 3D" skeuomorphic interfaces, like Calculator UI  https://t.co/0r47Iv5If0</font>

<font size="5">people were also doing interesting things with syntax highlighting. like the "monotony" theme, which uses no colors but different font effects to highlight syntax  https://t.co/BAgfNMoUqu</font>

<font size="5">of course, these days i prefer a super-minimal syntax theme that maintains consistency and helps me focus on the shape and meaning of the code.  plus it makes comments MORE visible, rather than less. which makes so much more sense!  https://t.co/u8QKGOFq33</font>
