<font size="5">question:   if you have old writing that you now disagree with, or are embarrassed by,   do you put it on your personal website? with a disclaimer maybe? or just hide it forevermore</font>

<font size="5">it's important to know that Twitter has two classes of poster: people over 10K followers, and everyone else.  if you're not an influencer, you might as well be just a tweet   https://t.co/nvIiv9Itxh</font>

<font size="5">That's what they mean by a heterogeneous representation: Your TL is literally different than other peoples. You're trapped in a bubble based on which influencers you follow.   This creates the phenomenon known as "ingroup", among others</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1414400962542907393">*19:47:22*</a>

<font size="5">basically the way this works is, if you're in the top 1% of Twitter users by following count, You're an influencer. The rest of us users are classified into SimClusters based on which influencers we follow in common.  This clustering is done before tweets are delivered to users.</font>

<font size="5">and THAT is why I need 10,000 followers. So I can create a SimCluster of my own, with my cool friends, and we can all hang out together. including you!  pray for me  https://t.co/v9IuF3SjgI</font>

<font size="5">I have been contacted by the Time Variance Authority. Apparently many of you are dangerous variants, and I'm going to be forced to prune you from my timeline.  😢 I'm sorry friends. This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you (except briefly)</font>
