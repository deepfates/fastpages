<font size="5">okay let me clarify.  what I realized with meme search is that I need to run the big PyTorch model on a server. And then have a web client that does image search for users.  I don't know where to put the database of files and their embeddings, or how to store it</font>

<font size="5">instead of rolling my own file system processors and pickling dictionaries of tensors, I would like to use a proper database.   (I will also probably upgrade to Jina neural search pipeline so I don't have to reinvent that wheel every time)  At that point, it's a CRUD app right?</font>

<font size="5">I need to stop getting in my own way and just put together high level parts. so I can iterate on actually userspace problems, instead of passing error messages around the stack</font>
