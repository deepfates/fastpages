<font size="5">if you feel like you came up with these ideas independently, that's probably true! we're literally studying our own minds here</font>

<font size="5">A lot of my former bandmates and traveling friends are still trying to live like they're in their 20s. Don't sign a lease, don't get a job, just couch surf and play music and do under the table jobs to get by.   I wonder when they're going to find out that we're old</font>

<font size="5">incidentally, this is why CLIP is perfect for meme search. I'd been wanting to make this program for a long time, but until now there wasn't a way to search for concepts embedded in both text and visual data. now there is   https://t.co/IZlsWnnby3</font>

<font size="5">I thought I was going to have to combine a bunch of things, OCR the text, object recognition on the images, combine a bunch of metadata and manual tags to make a classifier or something. but with CLIP it "just works" 😘</font>

<font size="5">unified meme theory draws on this paper, "Embodiment vs. Memetics," by Joanna Bryson. she says humans have a special combination of temporal imitation and second order thinking that creates semantic space fertile for memetic vectors  preprint pdf here  https://t.co/S7KGGXRXu9  https://t.co/lPSt6uVeSV</font>

<font size="5">temporal imitation: like birds, we have the ability to repeat short, ordered phrases of sound. birds do their little mating calls and dances, humans do too.  most of the types of creature don't do this call and response. So they don't have imitatable units of action</font>

<font size="5">The hall of mirrors is filled with the imitatable units of action, in all of their infinite slight variations.   it's a holographic construct, a multi-dimensional space intersecting with a smaller dimensional reality. that's semantic space.  You can move through it with your mind</font>

<font size="5">second order thinking: our heritage as troop primates means we think not only about the internal state of our fellows, but about their internal models of our state! or even of third parties.   this creates a hall of mirrors effect. You can go fractally in any direction</font>

<font size="5">Good question! memes don't have to be image macros. they could be visual, behavioral, sounds, motions. tiktok dances are memes. dabbing. imitatable, variational units of action   https://t.co/6Ss3K1YI5D</font>

<font size="5">what used to be "image macros" became the most common definition for "memes" tho, because they are so easily shared. humans are visual creatures. we can parse an image instantaneously, and words almost as fast. and early internet could share them faster than video.</font>

<font size="5">Now that video is cheap and fast to share, you can have all these other type of visual/behaviorism memes on tiktok (riding a skateboard + drinking cranberry juice + Fleetwood Mac * your_creative_addition_here)  but it still takes time to parse them, vs a screenshot or a meme.</font>

<font size="5">this is why viral tiktoks use overlaid captions, btw. it's a memetic grappling hook that grabs you and reels you into their region of memespace where you will then enjoy the video</font>

<font size="5">why would you text me for the first time in like 5 years just to say you're going to be in my town soon? I don't care about that? we don't have anything in common? You haven't thought about me and how long? Are you seriously just looking to sleep on my floor?  bitch I'm old now</font>
