<font size="5">I live in a city with over half a million people and there's something like two dozen cop cars on the streets at any given time.  obviously this number should be smaller, but it's good to remember that most of the time, you can break a law and there's nobody around to stop you</font>

<font size="5">I mean this is neat, don't get me wrong. but I've been using gnome for a long time, and if I want to find something I just type for it in the universal search bar.   maybe some people need the spatial organization of file icons on a desktop? or just it's the default for Mac?</font>

<font size="5">note towards the future writing style: I like when writers have a delicate touch. a thoughtful style, not a polemic one. rather than saying "I know how things are", say "I wonder why this is"</font>

<font size="5">understatement and dry humor and wit are more interesting than outrage and name calling. More likely to go over someone's head, for good and for bad.  This is hard, andI think people writing for mass audience have to do the opposite entirely. but I prefer my niche audience anyway</font>
