<font size="5">oh, once there's multipl tweets In the thread it gives me a button for "tweet all". so this is like I'm writing an essay and then sending all the tweets at once? I don't think I prefer that</font>

<font size="5">nice, i send the tweet and then i see the tweet. much better than sending me back to the TL like Twitter does. feels kind of like an empty page with one paragraph on it, and a + for adding to the thread</font>

<font size="5">This is just writing an essay and then posting it to Twitter. I don't think that the most popular makers of threads want this. seems like a tool more for writing press releases then a tool for thought</font>

<font size="5">it seems to me the way to thread tweets is to post them as you think of them. because people will instantaneously feedback into your thought process. That's why I built the burdock app: to give a feeling of someone else generating discursive thoughts that I can pick up on</font>

<font size="5">kind of cool, it lets me feel like I'm sending a tweet in that way. similar enough to the Twitter interface that it makes it feel permanent. but to go back and be able to edit previous tweets? That's not really a thing I want</font>

<font size="5">ah, I see. The button I thought meant "send tweet" means instead "switch to thread observing mode".</font>

<font size="5">Typefully is not pulling from Twitter tho. This does the"notes app with a slot machine"without the slot machine. but this actually feels nice for composing tweets. I'm not being interrupted, even by my mutuals.</font>

<font size="5">A lot of people see their best interactions in their mentions and their DMs and dimensions of their mutuals, though. places where you feel like you know the cast of characters and can talk to them. a place where you can endlessly nerd out</font>

<font size="5">however I will admit that I've made a lot of these little tweets here. it is literally easier to use than Twitter's main interface, where you are constantly being thrown back to the bullshit fire hose of the TL.</font>

<font size="5">to be honest, this is pretty sweet. I'm going to keep this open in a browser tab and test it out for a while. I actually did edit a couple of tweets before sending this thread lol</font>

<font size="5">And I was just able to go back to the top of this thread and tag the app's handle, which I hadn't done in the first place. but I think on Twitter I would have done it because the search feature is in line. had to go back to the Twitter app to find it just now</font>
