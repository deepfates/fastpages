<font size="5">A lot of so-called discourse on here is just people being like "things I don't understand sure are stupid". and then all their jagoff followers jumping in to agree</font>

<font size="5">2) no main TL. discord is all little rooms, there's no public commons. You join somebody's private server, theyre the God king and run it however they want. then within the server there all these separate little chat channels, And you can't tell who's looking at your posts or not</font>

<font size="5">1) infantilizing user experience. It literally says "links are spoopy!" anytime you try to follow a link somewhere out of discord. I'm not a gamer but I can't even imagine how they put up with this shit</font>

<font size="5">4) Patreon sync. if you have a patreon, you can set it up to give invites to your private discord for people who patronize you. This is what creates the laughable dynamic of every "dirtbag" podcast: "we hate capitalism! send us $5 to join our parasocial friend group!"</font>

<font size="5">3) synchronous chat experience. all chat rooms have this problem, where to understand what's been happening you have to scroll through endless reams of chronological messages. Twitter's DAG is much more usable for search and discovery</font>

<font size="5">The longer that bystanders avoid the confrontation, the more heated it gets, as the arguers try to drag them in. until it has poisoned the entire history of the chat channel and one or the other gets kicked</font>

<font size="5">5) semi public real time interface creates bad social dynamics. this happens in twitter gcs as well, where people puff themselves up arguing with each other because they feel like they have an audience to play to  meanwhile, the rest of them gc is just waiting for it to end</font>

<font size="5">At least on Reddit, where you expect to see this shit, they have sub threads that get hidden after a certain level of back and forth. Twitter makes top-level comments the default view, instead of sub-threads at all, which is perhaps a more democratic dynamic</font>

<font size="5">but discord makes real-time, high-context, status-thick interactions the norm. And if you can't be ready to have one of those all the time from your phone, well, get ready for for FOMO I guess</font>

<font size="5">the structural metaphor of these little rooms with these charismatic personalities hosting them is to create a warren of micro-cults.   they're not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with them</font>

<font size="5">A group chat should be a space station from which you all explore a shared world. gamers use discord correctly.  anybody who tries to make it a world of its own is in trouble, because they're living in a space station with some strangers from the internet   https://t.co/WMLQB6UPu0</font>

<font size="5">I know that the name's discord and slack are actually references to the discordians and the Church of the subgenius and that's very nifty.   but every time I click on a button that says "discord", something happens in the language part of my brain anyway  https://t.co/BP61mz5r3B</font>

<font size="5">For those who are asking what a better alternative would be? look into the forum software called "Discourse". It has rooms and conversations like old style forums but has modern social media affordances.  I actually have a discourse server set up somewhere 🤔</font>

<font size="5">3 SEAL AND STEAM  Your kitchen pot lid does not seal well enough. No one's does. Use a large piece of tinfoil, clamped underneath the lid, to hold the steam in.  Immediately upon boiling, seal and turn the heat down to Low. Yes Low! very low. the steam is doing the work here</font>
