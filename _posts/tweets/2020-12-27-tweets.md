<font size="5">language models regurgitate personal data and copyrighted text (no secret to anyone who's worked with them). what does this mean for privacy and fair use?  https://t.co/JFZyMQfwB9</font>

<font size="5">i really don't think One Page of Harry Potter can possibly count as copyright infringement though. that definitely seems like a "trivial portion"  https://t.co/jL1FPI2whX</font>

<font size="5">I've been wondering about this in context of recorded music: if i use spleeter (a neural network) to split vocals and accompaniment in a song, then reattach them, is it a new song? it sounds just like the old one but lower quality... but it's entirely generated from spectrograms</font>

<font size="5">i think the reason it says "unvarnished" so often is  the vector transform used to generate the free association thoughts. currently it's "simple" -&gt; "uncomplicated". hmm. going to try a new one today</font>

<font size="5">it looks like that was a fail state because there aren't any vectors for emoji in spacy's en_core_web_md model. I added vectors from emoji2vec to the vocab table and now it knows emoji  https://t.co/YZ78ozO80q</font>

<font size="5">the linear algebra on these vectors isn't doing much. oh well. i need to build a better question-generating system in the long run, traversing vector space can only go so far. i made the duck use less-similar topn vectors so that it will make bigger intuitive leaps. for now</font>
