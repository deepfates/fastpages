<font size="5">ex.: I have written most of this thread using Google voice typing, except for the part which I copy and pasted from the link above. And Gboard has a clipboard history so I was able to copy both the quote and the link without switching back and forth between apps again</font>

<font size="5">ex. on my ride to work I was listening to the leaked Kanye album DONDA, and I wanted to skip through one of the songs. but this leak file is just a single MP3 for the whole album.   I touched my earbud for 3 seconds, said "skip ahead 2 minutes", and VLC immediately scrub forward</font>

<font size="5">it's pretty amazing that Paul McCartney's collab with Kanye is his most popular song by an order of magnitude.   It even beats out his work with that one band, on sheer number of listens  https://t.co/RJLKCU1Zwt</font>
