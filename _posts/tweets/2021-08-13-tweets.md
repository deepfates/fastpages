<font size="5">This is fine. Really! it's just this is called practicing your instrument, not playing music.   Just like how it's not really sex if you're doing it by yourself   https://t.co/vJGLgDbRiM</font>

<font size="5">My biggest peeve with the post rat community is the same reason I left the new age hippie community: low standards for epistemology lead to cults of personality. and a religious regard for irrational thinking</font>

<font size="5">nobody even wanted this kimchi but we were taking it to the rainbow gathering so we couldn't just ditch it.   also the bus kept breaking down and everyone else just wanted to fix it by pretending it wasn't breaking down</font>

<font size="5">The young wizard and the old wizard are walking through the forest and it starts to rain.   The young wizard says, are you going to do a spell to make it stop raining?   The old wizard says, No. We are going to sit under this tree and wait until it stops by itself</font>

<font size="5">wondering if perhaps this is just a feature of Twitter. as I've seen it in other groups as well.  very hard not to become a caricature of yourself when so many people are giving you instantaneous feedback on your weird internet behavior</font>

<font size="5">what I wanted: a group of people with open minds and good conversational standards, practiced in the art of achieving mutual understanding and coherence with reality  what I got: weird religious people with talk shows. and a bunch of zoomers who can't tell the difference</font>

<font size="5">This analysis is almost not wrong. Cult of personality are most things that humans do. but they are specifically the least effective thing that humans do, unless you are the leader of the cult.  engineering, though, does not respond to flattery   https://t.co/YdTAu3vK1N</font>
