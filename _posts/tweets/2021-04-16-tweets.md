<font size="5">okay some of you are making memes, which is very cool. sometimes I make a meme. mostly I used to get memes from Facebook meme groups and Instagram me and pages, but I don't like using those apps so I have been shy of memes. there are a couple of meme accounts on this site too tho</font>

<font size="5">This is based on real numbers from the SIM clusters paper. Twitter clusters you into a group with other people based on which big accounts you follow. Big account is roughly over 10K</font>
