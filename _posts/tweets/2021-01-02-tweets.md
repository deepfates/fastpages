<font size="5">i found out about typing-booster on GNOME this year and I bout lost my mind. it's like emoji autocomplete, and it works for special characters too. so i could type like "pound" and get £ in autocomplete.   you enter this mode with Super+Space. much better than unicode compose key</font>

<font size="5">pipe a transformer model through it, obviously. something like Kite or TabNine but for natural text instead of code. might be a good platform for an alternative to eg. Gmail's autosuggestion</font>

<font size="5">apparently ibus was developed for typing in non-English languages but now it's the interface library for Fedora and   what else could you do with this?</font>

<font size="5">inserting this at the operating system level, as an always-available keyboard extension, is more useful than having separate autocomplete history in firefox, chrome, jupyter, terminal, twitter, etc</font>

<font size="5">could keep all user data locally as well. i think TabNine does this? indexes your project folder to access all your functions and relative paths and such.   integrate with GNOME tracker, (which I secretly love) and a  more verbose notifications and you have Android on Linux</font>
