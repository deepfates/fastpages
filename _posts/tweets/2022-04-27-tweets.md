<font size="5">okay I really want to work on AI projects but I don't have a good resume. My background is in landscaping and bookselling before I ever learned Python. I have no papers published, and no college degree.   How do I convince people I'm worth hiring</font>

<font size="5">I feel I should clarify: when I say work, I mean like a Job. Not like "get loans to go to college" or "do free internships" or "work for free on open source projects". I have bills to pay.   And I will kick so much ass for anybody who will hire me as long as I can pay them</font>

<font size="5">The problem with social media is that opinions are like armpits.  Everyone thinks that theirs smell kind of good</font>

<font size="5">finally got the executive function to get my broken down van taken away. Now I just have to get the emotional resilience to go clean all the shit from 2018 out of it</font>
