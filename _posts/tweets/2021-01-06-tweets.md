<font size="5">social graph 2 has two pictures on it: the first has nodes sized by in-degree (how many people that i follow, follow that person) and labels shaded by out-degree (how many people that person follows that I also follow). the second picture is the opposite</font>

<font size="5">in-degree sort of represents Authority, and out-degree Connectedness. in this case, because it's limited to the people I follow, out-degree is a decent proxy for "sees a similar TL" and in-degree is a proxy for "sees similar reply-guys"</font>
