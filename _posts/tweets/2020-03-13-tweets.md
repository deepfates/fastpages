<font size="5">The one thing to learn from a pandemic is that we are all literally connected. Unfortunately, individualists would rather let millions die than open their eyes. I'll be putting in the work to save others. You'll be hiding in your house waiting for the stonks to go up. good luck</font>

<font size="5">In small part this is because I tucked away rice, beans and ramen weeks ago. ABQ has only just begun to panic, since the schools closed last night. And a little bit is the normal headrush of buying food, while hungry, on payday</font>

<font size="5">Largely, though, I'm energized by crisis. I spent my twenties careening from crisis to crisis, constantly under threat of eviction or starvation or infection. I thrive in emergency. I'm bout to clean my whole damn house</font>

<font size="5">Too, the daily grind in America is a long slow catastrophe. There's nothing to do, no obvious way to save anyone, yet every day people are going hungry and getting sick and suffering. But the illusion of normalcy makes it all bearable, long enough to get drunk and go to bed again</font>

<font size="5">The world ending is not a bad thing. I don't want people to suffer unnecessarily. But that's the reality of most people's days: we suffer unnecessarily! We don't need to produce, package, market, sell, bag, and consume all this garbage. Nobody wants this</font>

<font size="5">We want to be happy. We want to have meaningful work to do for people who care about us. I know, because I wasn't happy, so I looked up what makes people happy, and I tried it. And it's working</font>

<font size="5">Again, I'm not happy that people will get sick or die. Except, there was this bigass redneck in the store wearing one of those USA shirts where the flag is like rivulets of blood running down his chest...</font>

<font size="5">This dude looked at the ransacked pasta aisle and said "Can you believe, all this for the flu?" With a knowing look, like we're in on a joke together. That guy can get sick</font>

<font size="5">I know that doesn't make me a badass. What do I care if he's been listening to the wrong end of TV and puts himself at risk? Except, the little old ladies in that aisle seemed grateful. Meatneck isn't the one endangered by his stupidity. They are</font>

<font size="5">Obviously this one virus, with its R0 and CFR, is not the end of the whole world. But it's a harbinger, and goddam i love a harbinger</font>

<font size="5">The knock-on effects are impossible to predict, but here's a guess: the market crash reveals the fact that no real value has been created since 2008. Just stock buybacks, quantitative easing, the Airbnb real estate bubble, and the SoftBank shell game</font>

<font size="5">Somewhere between a thousand and a million people are dead from COVID. I would love to think that some of our political misleaders are among them, and that Bernie is not. But his odds aren't great either, so let's ignore the presidency. it doesn't affect as much as people think</font>

<font size="5">Economic depression: people lose their jobs, businesses go under, retirement funds go down the drain. The richest people are bailed out, of course. This is still America</font>

<font size="5">But we'll all have seen it, we can't unsee: we didn't need to be "growing" the "economy". Those who are most fortunate got to spend a few months playing with their kids, walking the dog, catching up on books and TV shows. Why would they want capitalism to come roaring back?</font>

<font size="5">Some of us have been worse off. We've been caring for the sick, feeding the hungry, supporting the burnt-out doctors and nurses. And, of course, burying the dead</font>

<font size="5">Many people have gotten sick and gotten over it. From my understanding, this is the sort of virus you can build an immunity to. At least for a year or so, until it mutates again. This is the case with the four coronaviruses already endemic in the human population</font>

<font size="5">Many people have suffered greatly from this virus by the end of this year. They have survived, or they haven't, and the sorry state of our healthcare system has become visible to all. We realize again that we are not competing individuals. We remember that our destinies are tied</font>

<font size="5">Somewhere in me there is an optimist peering through the dark glass of material reality. That part of me hopes, despite all evidence, that the supply chains will not collapse, that we will not fall prey to xenophobia and warlordism. That I can keep tweeting while the world burns</font>

<font size="5">I don't know if that's good or bad. What I know is that this system cannot last. The internal contradictions have become too much to bear. We need to start envisioning the world we want to live in. Because the alternative is bleak.</font>

<font size="5">Anyway my hands are starting to crack from all this typing. Time to go wash them again, and moisturize, and clean the house, and make some kraut for when the fresh veg runs out.  Now is not the time to despair. Now is the time to start building. That's why I'm excited.</font>
