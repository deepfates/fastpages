<font size="5">i don't know anyone particular weak spots, but generally this can help with:  - choice of targets - feedback loop of results - mental model of causal factors - better precision/accuracy (due to above) - total power usage (due to better precision/accuracy)   https://t.co/rvHOJLmvls</font>

<font size="5">A lot of people make a big inferential leap from "the government did good R&amp;D spending in the 20th century that became all of the cool tech we have now" to "The government we have now could do good R&amp;D spending as well" And I'm just not sure that's true</font>

<font size="5">sometimes i think, instead of becoming a data scientist or programmer in some big company, I should just start a podcast where I interview cool people who are building the future. but the income distribution for podcasters so much less predictable ☹️</font>

<font size="5">okay, I'm trying to figure out if I could afford to put out a regular podcast.  let's say it's called "deeptakes". weekly, hour-ish interviews with people who are building and writing abt the future. some of them you know, some will be surprise.  would you subscribe? for how much</font>

<font size="5">You might think, why is these two things incompatible? why not have podcast and be tech brother?  In which case, I'm excited for you to find out the type of things I will say on the podcast</font>

<font size="5">bad part about this website is that it exposes you to so many Takes. Like today I saw someone say "if we taught the humanities more in schools, we wouldn't have had Facebook and therefore Trump" and that's... just a thought that had never occurred to me and that I will never need</font>

<font size="5">the podcast would also be about superheroification. specifically, learning the origin stories and powers of your favorite posters, and building their legend. everyone has wisdom inside them if you can get it to come out   https://t.co/i2ymfO8jRD</font>
