<font size="5">I have some friends who are future oriented and into space, AI, etc. but they've bought into the academic/activist left worldview and it clearly causes them a great deal of cognitive dissonance  You know they're not going to stop with Elon right? nobody gets to leave this planet</font>

<font size="5">there are good ideas that come from the left! and good values.   but the current alliance of authoritarians, degrowthers, and dogpiling conformists is a death sentence for the species</font>

<font size="5">This is true. I have bought into this before, the it"plutocratic exit strategy worldview.   but it's not true. The more you try to build a habitat off this planet, the more you know How amazing and precarious the biosphere is.   https://t.co/Y3S3ofACYn</font>

<font size="5">I think people underestimate the political realignment coming. The context collapse of the internet causes everyone to frantically seek in group/out group boundaries, and portray the outgroup as unclean. So far this has happened a long nominally left/right lines, but not for long</font>

<font size="5">the stem player is a rock. it feels like a knapping stone in my hand.   it dropped in an opaque way, and people have built a cargo cult around it  it is very cool. still limited, but it feels liek the first new instrument since the synth</font>

<font size="5">like, DAWs take all the musical constructs of the 20th century and package them up into software. But the stem player packages up some of those same effects into a new physical mnemonic</font>

<font size="5">when i said cargo cult i meant only that it comes with few instructions, and people have built a reddit and a discord and a wiki and youtube explainers and a google drive full of stems &amp;c&amp;c&amp;c</font>

<font size="5">this document has me convinced that i can, if i am careful, delete Donda album stems. but i will have to edit config files by hand.  if have i do this more than once i will be speaking with my Python kernel   https://t.co/AQaXmpEQi4</font>

<font size="5">that's the stem player community wiki. it is 17 pages long.   the first 3 pages are scan of the original comic-style manual, which is very cool and opaque. it is a little frustrating that i had to do internet archaeology to find it, so i'm linking it here for my future self</font>

<font size="5">the wiki is written by an earnest group of (gamers / teenagers)? who are reverse engineering the stem player's internal state. it is helpful.   however as a coder i think, i should automate this. and then open source a library. it is not as hard as they're making it sound  https://t.co/QTx2quFWuK</font>

<font size="5">of course, i understand that updates will come, that's the advantage of software, ship the MVP, Kanye patches his albums, blah blah blah. there should be, and will eventually be, a universal interface to the musical potato device. if not by the makers, then by the hackers</font>

<font size="5">and yes tbc the stem player website allows some file management. as well as the stemming itself, which is awesome!  I just am in the very tiny minority of users who already have spleeter installed on my GPU machine, so I want to treat it as a filesystem    https://t.co/SebYOrBwvW</font>
