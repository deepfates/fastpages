<font size="5">seriously though, one of the most common features of people who are letting their minds be ruled by someone else, is that they argue really strongly against the possibility that might be what's happening</font>

<font size="5">I have also discovered he's rebooted the project without me, under a new name. which is fine, as I don't want to collaborate with him anymore. but still a weird feeling</font>

<font size="5">I miss having my best friend. but I don't miss feeling betrayed on the regular, or being belittled anytime there's an audience. And I don't know how to tell which person he is now, or if it's even possible to separate the behaviors I liked from the ones I couldn't stand</font>
