<font size="5">postmortem: I decided early on that I didn't want to have to personally analyze the vibe of various good users, so I would use some empirical measurement that I could simply place on a grid. and everybody has a pair of coordinates on their profile:  Followeing         Followers</font>

<font size="5">I thought this was just going to be a funny joke but everyone was so fiending for more personal identification after the last mystery political compass. by the time I did grocery shopping And got off work there were too many to place individually.</font>

<font size="5">So, instead of going to bed with my hot gf, I stayed up late using twint to scrape all the repliers to that tweet, get their follower and following numbers, and plot that on a graph. I already had a function for plotting images, from circles project   https://t.co/W6DMfgsGDn</font>

<font size="5">oh and if you were wondering, both the x and y axis are plotted on log scale. otherwise everyone would be in one tight blob in the corner with a few obvious outliers.  the minimum and maximum of the graph are set within possible coordinates. That's why you have people on the edge</font>

<font size="5">1) arable land is expensive, farming requires a lot of land, growing all your own food is basically impossible unless you want to spend literally all your time doing it.   we grew a lot of fresh veg but got our staples with food stamps or cash</font>

<font size="5">2) hierarchies and in-group/outgroup dynamics are probably hardwired in humans. if you attempt to suppress them, they will become invisible, and then you can't even talk about them. This is well covered terrain, "tyranny of structurelessness material", but it hurts to see it irl</font>

<font size="5">oops, first message should read "at an anarchist commune"* but too late now  anyway it was a semi-restored ghost town in the middle of the national forest, 13 miles of dirt and 60 miles of 1lane highway to a gas station  i've written about it before here  https://t.co/K34IutWfLd</font>

<font size="5">3) energy is expensive.  when i arrived there was just a DIY Pelton wheel, which is a micro-hydro generator built with a car alternator  me and friends installed some solar panels (we peer-pressured a visitor from NYC to buy them for us)  and then there's wood</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403390771177402371">*10:36:48*</a>

<font size="5">we're in the forest, so there's tons of wood available. the main stove was a huge wood burner and the hot water for the main house was heated by running it through pipes in the main stove.  small stoves in every cabin. we burned wood all year, whether it was 8°F or 108°</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403391239806980098">*10:38:39*</a>

<font size="5">but to get all that wood required a bunch of hippies to get in the pickup, drive up the mountain, fell trees with chainsaw, buck and throw the wood and come back and chop it all to size. so you need a bunch of gasoline and food to get wood. "hippie power" is food-based energy</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403391824216141826">*10:40:59*</a>

<font size="5">and to get all that food, without much arable land, requires you to go to town. and it takes gasoline to go to town, and to get back. so you're always going to town.   we would regularly spend 6+ hours in the car and 8+ hours doing errands in a town 100 miles away. sustainable?</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403392693443629063">*10:44:26*</a>

<font size="5">some people would argue that this was all immoral and that we should eat only what we grew on the land and cut all the wood with a crosscut saw (the old-timey one that has a person on either end), aka the "misery whip"  but then, where do you get the food to give you energy?</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403393321494618115">*10:46:56*</a>

<font size="5">you can't, of course. anyone can do the math on this, but most people won't. especially the primitivists. they prefer their narrative over reality. they eat the food that other people get from town. i don't know how they get over this cognitive dissonance, but they're good at it</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403393813335400449">*10:48:53*</a>

<font size="5">it takes roughly 10 acres of farmland to support a single person for a year, including grains and animals and everything. maybe you can get that down a little with permaculture technique and wildcrafting.  we had one and a half acres of meadow</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1403394280626995207">*10:50:44*</a>

<font size="5">if you're using a lot of wood, say if it's a really snowy year or if you have a lot of people wanting to use the one shower (it's in front of the kitchen window, and there's no curtain, but you can handle that right, you're cool right?)...  maybe double the number of calories</font>

<font size="5">so energy is expensive, it's hard to get it reliably, you have to get it from town, and it takes energy to get to town.  hmm.... unwise</font>

<font size="5">4) a network of permanent autonomous zones is a hard thing to protect  the temporary autonomous zone -- like Rainbow Gathering, or Burning Man, or OWS -- appears and disappears, shifts and transforms in location and composition over time.  a permanent zone is a sitting duck</font>

<font size="5">a real "permanent autonomous zone" is like the Zapatista municipalities in Chiapas, or the Kurds in Rojava. you want autonomy? simple. defend yourself against every sovereign power that claims power over you.   how you gonna do that at the peacenik commune? u have like one gun</font>

<font size="5">now you're going to have a network of them? you're going to travel through the entire American West to go to the peanut butter commune to trade for goat milk?  or are you going to build relations in nearby cities? what do you have that they would want</font>

<font size="5">there are so many ghost towns in America. there will be so many more, soon. it is good for small groups of people to come together and try different things.  and i think i learned more in my 20s than people who went to college 🤔</font>

<font size="5">because...  6) autonomy is an illusion  i think Americans especially have this DIY ethos that is admirable and stupid at the same time. everybody is told that inventors and revolutionaries are the heroes of history. so they keep re-inventing the wheel  the heinlein quote is wrong  https://t.co/Uro3cV0wPX</font>

<font size="5">once you accept that you are part of a giant time-binding hyperorganism called "society" or whatever, you can align yourself with the processes around you.   instead of living dependent on yet hostile to the hive, convincing yourself that it's Chaotic Good because Society is Evil</font>

<font size="5">this is a good question  https://t.co/7AUirmB1xa  we didn't have enough water power for this. it took over a mile of pipe run downhill to get enough pressure for the Pelton wheel and we still couldn't run power tools  oh, and the water started to dry up in 2013 😅😬😅😬😅😬😅</font>

<font size="5">some guys did get an Alaskan mill and start making boards. (that's basically a frame that you put on the log to make your chainsaw go in right angles).  two or three of them would run it all day and make like... ten boards? fifteen?  idk cuz they were my enemies and i didn't help</font>

<font size="5">work is HARD WORK. doing things yourself, the long way, is a pain in the ass.  i think it is GOOD to do it,  and i would like it if there were a program you could go instead of college where you just go do hard work and live a low-energy life so you appreciate the GOD DAMN CITY</font>

<font size="5">i live in the city now because it's like a ten minute walk to the food store where somebody has already made food supplies that i can literally buy with money i worked for at something i'm good at and enjoy.   people do cities for a reason. LARPers know this but don't admit</font>

<font size="5">correcting this, I was misremembering "5 to 10 acres per family". which is maybe four people? I don't know. I made all these calculations in like 2015, based on pessimistic view where I was trying to find reasons to leave. That's my bias   https://t.co/ksT6gDTw8R</font>

<font size="5">the bot has a good point. nuclear generators would make an excellent solution for small self-sustaining communes.   This might work on Mars, or if you have institutional backing. but the sovereign powers are notoriously stingy about who gets to nukes   https://t.co/jxrdhfwnuG</font>
