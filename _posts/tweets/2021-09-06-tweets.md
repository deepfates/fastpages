<font size="5">these bottles are a great deal. they have some weird liquid in them at first, but once you get rid of that they're very sturdy bottles.   i like to keep a couple in the freezer and throw them in the cooler instead of a bag of ice. They don't leak either  https://t.co/ruj8kom2zH</font>

<font size="5">no words are etymologically pure. all the original words were destroyed in the nam-shub incident.   the closest thing we have are the barewords, and those are as rare as suitcase nukes. And about as dangerous</font>
