So they can reproduce, they can change, and they can inherit changes. The ingredients for evolution..  send memes</font>

<font size="5">the google photos app, on my google brand phone, is pretty good. it does custom face recognition for people and pets, and it can detect various categories.   these are prob. different neural nets trained on-phone or in the cloud, and deployed differently based on what you shoot</font>

<font size="5">google phone also has Lens, which is specialized NN camera. it can do real-time OCR on text, and place it in mostly the right alignment on the page. it can translate text from every language i've tried it on. it can search for objects on the internet. it can do your homework</font>

<font size="5">but google is big and slow and ships their org chart. and they have to be conservative, because they're going for a broad market.  an open source version could move faster, lead the way. and then if they want to copy it, oh well. at least it is available to all the people</font>
