<font size="5">Every time I am trying to read some math notation i think, why is this system so overcoded? they only had Greek alphabet, American alphabet, Arabic numerals, and reused them over and over.   why not draw some new squiggles man  https://t.co/SfJCxMYTrA</font>

<font size="5">This is brilliant, instead of retraining language models to expect keywords that appear further in the text (like CTRL did), they adjust the score of generated suggestions by their vector similarity to the keywords.  scoring algorithms are plug and play 😱</font>

<font size="5">interesting result: people are more likely to have facial fair in the last couple years, than in the last previous decade!   I wonder if this is just because the average lifespan of a beard cycle? or if the mask era has definitively changed something about face hair</font>

<font size="5">I think new squiggles would be easier to write if they weren't all optimized for blackboard length.  Like I appreciate the variable type highlighting effect, butwhat if the names of vars and functions were just their names, like in code?   https://t.co/uSp2Eyo4vb</font>

<font size="5">For local-first software, what are the philosophies behind indexing of media libraries? Like Calibre wants to move all your files into its own directory tree system, versus VLC which indexes your media in-place</font>

<font size="5">Normalize having lots of books you haven't read!   It's okay to have a book on your nightstand, a book in the bathroom, a book by the gun on the mantelpiece, a book by the living room couch, a book in your car, a book in your purse, a body in your basement, a book for the road &amp;c</font>
