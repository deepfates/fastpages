<font size="5">it worked! at least, it seems like it's prodcuing fewer whitespace characters. But i do kind of like the whitespace in the interpolations. it looks like a blank page with magic ink appearing on it.  gf says this one is "Soothing"  https://t.co/MEGnyINFUF</font>

<font size="5">it wasn't just the image augmentation. they were like five images in there that were literally white space, and quite a few that were super tiny. so I removed the white space and like 600 little punctuation marks, hopefully now it'll learn some of the more complex characters</font>

<font size="5">I mean, one might say that Bob defining the power elite as himself and his friends was hubristic. after all he died poor and low-status (though not friendless).  but do we not live in his world now?</font>

<font size="5">A lot of people have opinions about things, and you might think you have to convince them that they're wrong. but first think: does this person have any power? does it matter what their opinion is? Can they enforce it on other people, or is it only hurting them</font>

<font size="5">this actually seems like a great working principle.  I used to hate being limited by society, when I wanted to enact my will upon the world. but looking back, that guy was kind of a dumbass and a jerk. so I'm glad he didn't have too much power</font>

<font size="5">this is definitely working. more complicated characters, less whitespace. the color blobs and noise textures are because I've caught it at a phase where the generator is learning something new. 10hrs of training (with a high gradient-accumulate-every setting) on top the old net  https://t.co/aH9i6h2upE</font>
