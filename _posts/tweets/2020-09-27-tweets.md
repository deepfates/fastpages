<font size="5">basically, Twitter uses a latent space of simulated "communities" as the topology of the network.   the top 1% of users are considered "influencers". if a group of influencers have a lot of shared incoming connxns they become a "community"</font>

<font size="5">these simulated clusters go on a gigantic sparse matrix with all types of content: users, tweets, hashtags, "Events". this way they can use nearest-neighbor analysis rather than heavy matrix multiplications, as well as representing all content in the same latent space</font>

<font size="5">all Users can belong to one or more of these Communities, and so can all Tweets. Influencers can change the shape of these communities, through their actions, but only indirectly: attracting or repelling different followers.  if you're not an influencer, you're basically a tweet</font>
