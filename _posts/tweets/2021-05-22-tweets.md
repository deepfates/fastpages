<font size="5">read this PDF yesterday and it has some very cool things to say about the Canon of literature.  essentially they map authors in a 2D space where the x-axis is popularity on goodreads and the y-axis is number of citations in MLA papers   https://t.co/XVdzknZorB</font>

<font size="5">you can define a quadrant system with lines at the xy medians.   NE - prestigious but not popular. academic darlings NW - prestigious and popular. the sweet spot SW - popular but not prestigious. genre fiction, guilty pleasures SE - neither. unknowns, undesirables, the forgotten  https://t.co/rQN1gdbghI</font>

<font size="5">this canonicity is fractal: if you zoom in on the top right corner, the same dynamics are at play. even at double zoom, look at the author names:  NE: Milton, Joyce, Beckett NW: Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen SW: Rowling, Orwell, Salinger SE: DeLillo, Roth, Rushdie 💀💀💀  https://t.co/XqNgZQyzqJ</font>

<font size="5">but check it out: all those graphs are log-scaled, meaning each tick on the graph is an order of magnitude. if you try to graph them all on a linear scale, only a few dozen authors escape the singularity. these are the "hypercanon"  can you find your favorites on here?  https://t.co/K6aH9Uc8YQ</font>
