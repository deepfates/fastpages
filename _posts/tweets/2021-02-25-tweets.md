<font size="5">since Twitter is the sticky note sharing device I have decided to start posting things that I otherwise would just scrawl somewhere. things that are mostly for me to read later. they are not necessarily what I believe. (I can use this disclaimer later if people fuk w me)</font>

<font size="5">then, too, your ability to get information from others about things outside of your local environment is polluted by those others' motivation to deceive you. it is very tricky to get large amounts of humans to cooperate transparently instead of backstabbing each other for status</font>

<font size="5">on another level, the concepts that you use to engage with reality are not necessarily coherent objects in the real world. A lot of things we think are Nouns are actually just Verbing as part of a greater process</font>

<font size="5">for one thing, literally everything you experience is a reconstruction of the universe, a hologram builds of sensory input and your own biases. Even if you suppress the gatekeeping of the conscious mind you can't escape the limited processing power of your physical brain</font>

<font size="5">One more level: Even if the official sources of truth all agreed with each other about the facts, there's a whole industry (and multiple organs of govt) devoted to espionage, secret technologies, cyber operations, psyops, biological and memetic warfare. even remote viewing!</font>

<font size="5">Very interesting post. Seems to me the Gini coefficient could work as a proxy for control over other people's financial destiny?   and there's a simple way to reduce the Gini coefficient using government, without complicated regulation... 🧦🧦🧦</font>

<font size="5">when I was a young man I would get together with a bunch of other young men and we would all slobber on a huge blunt and pass it around in a circle, just coughing all over each other.   I worry for today's youth, who will grow up never knowing this experience</font>

<font size="5">The thing that Twitter has made me notice is that reading is not linear. you would probably read a small sentence that I post after this long sentence, before finishing reading the first sentence. at least enough to understand the context  see what I mean?</font>
