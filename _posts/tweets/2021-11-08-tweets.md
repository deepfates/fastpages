<font size="5">How do you organize your apps on your phone? Do you use the home screen? Do you group them by function, in folders, in pages? Do you use widgets? I'm fascinated by this intimate secret relationship everyone has with the icons that open apps</font>

<font size="5">I've been fascinated with DAOs since 2016 when i saw the potential of Ξ.   DAOs are the platform cooperative model that people have been looking for since Occupy. but things were stagnant for a long time after The DAO hack.  now i see things picking up. i want to get involved</font>

<font size="5">the technology brethren have a unique advantage in their fast-growth starter model: the employees get shares.  a startup that IPOs creates a social milieu of high-agency millionaires, with high-trust relationships.

<font size="5">I'm not sure I'm persuaded that this could be accomplished with just web2 and regular corporate law. but, squad wealth has to start somewhere.   i know that a lot of my mutuals are trying to build a *better internet*... what if we made a DAO to do it?  we could prototype in DMs</font>
