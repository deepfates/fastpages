<font size="5">very good thread on Qanon as ARG, but I feel this point is a bit naïve.   just because "good" people consulted for DoD does not preclude "bad" people from doing so as well. and they've been studying narrative/memetic warfare for over a decade (that we know of)</font>

<font size="5">we know that narrative warfare is real, and is a key part of the netwar doctrine that guides nation-state thinking RN. to assume no state actors are pushing Qanon is wishful thinking. the question is, which actors?</font>

<font size="5">I'm not trying to do a Russiagate here; that too is a weaponized narrative. I assume they're motivated just like other state powers. but I think more likely the Qanon/Russiagate ops represent a power struggle between factions within the American security apparatus</font>
