    @ExAstrisUmbra yes but it's a feedback loop. you make profits by pleasing customers, you please customers by making their lives easier. And to do that you have to surprise them, you have to innovate. which means you have to constantly be trying to generate markets to see if there's demand

    @blisstweeting honestly I don't think you need much hardware, it's set up so you can use CPU instructions instead of GPU if you want. but let me know if you have any problems with it cuz I have not optimized for different machines yet
