<font size="5">Nor is there, strictly speaking, any space.  Nevertheless, L-space is infinitely large and connects all libraries, everywhere and everywhen.  It’s never further than the other side of the bookshelf, yet only the most senior and respected librarians know the way in.</font>

<font size="5">Knowledge = power = energy = matter = mass, and on that simple equation rests the whole of L-space.  It is via L-space that all books are connected (quoting the ones before them, and influencing the ones that come after).  But there is no time in L-space.</font>

<font size="5">Books bend space and time.  One reason the owners of those aforesaid little rambling, poky second-hand bookshops always seem slightly unearthly is that many of them really are,</font>

<font size="5">In theory, because of the nature of L-space, absolutely everything was available to him, but that only meant that it was more or less impossible to find whatever it was you were looking for, which is the purpose of computers.</font>

<font size="5">This is obvious: books inspire other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past.  But the General Theory of L-Space suggests that, in that case, the contents of books as yet unwritten can be deduced from books now in existence.</font>

<font size="5">... a magical library, built on a very thin patch of space-time.  There were books on distant shelves that hadn’t been written yet, books that never would be written.  At least, not here.  It had a circumference of a few hundred yards, but there was no known limit to its radius.</font>

<font size="5">Future books exist in potentia, as it were, in the same way that a sufficiently detailed study of a handful of primal ooze will eventually hint at the future existence of prawn crackers.</font>

<font size="5">All books are tenuously connected through L-space and, therefore, the content of any book ever written or yet to be written may, in the right circumstances, be deduced from a sufficiently close study of books already in existence.</font>

<font size="5">One book could be a library, if it was a book that made a big enough dimple in L-space. A book with a title like 100 Ways with Broccoli was unlikely to be one such, whereas The Relationship Between Capital and Labour might be, especially if it had an appendix on making explosives</font>

<font size="5">Energy equals matter... He swung into an avenue of shelving that was apparently a few feet long and walked along it briskly for half an hour. Matter equals mass. And mass distorts space. It distorts it into polyfractal L-space.</font>

<font size="5">Power equals energy... People were stupid, sometimes. They thought the Library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books, which was true enough, but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library.</font>

<font size="5">So, while the Dewey system has its fine points, when you're setting out to look something up in the multidimensional folds of L-space what you really need is a ball of string.</font>

<font size="5">All books of magic have a life of their own.  Some of the really energetic ones can’t simply be chained to the bookshelves; they have to be nailed shut or kept between steel plates.</font>

<font size="5">The Librarian was, of course, very much in favour of reading in general, but readers in particular got on his nerves.  There was something, well, sacrilegious about the way they kept taking books off the shelves and wearing out the words by reading them.</font>
