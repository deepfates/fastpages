<font size="5">Open AI codex demo is really good. When they use the codex model to record directly to the JavaScript API inside Microsoft Word... That's next level. That means that natural language can now manipulate programs internals</font>

<font size="5">aftera year of being the game master for a Pathfinder AP — a pre-written adventure path — I think the biggest challenge is pacing. The story I ran had tons of battles, but they become monotonous without contrasting story beats. The writers thought in encounters rather than scenes</font>

<font size="5">Thank you all for your help. after obsessive research I ended up picking this Juiced Camp Scrambler.   because it has a geared hub motor instead of a single speed, was relatively cheap and in stock. if I need something more powerful I will sell this one and get a mid-drive bike  https://t.co/QIPOjJ2RMc</font>

<font size="5">My decision was heavily weighted by the fact that I need this bike to look cool and be fun to ride. Not geeky. All the Rad bikes looks like they are for young urban parents and I just cannot</font>
