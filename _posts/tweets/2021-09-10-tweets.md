<font size="5">thinking about GNOME Assistant today.   it's been hinted as a possibility in GNOME 4. some kind of collaborative human agent dialogue, or natural language interface  it's really what their design is tending toward anyway, and maybe the only way to make it usable</font>

<font size="5">Do I got to write a book about this? dang it.   I don't know how to do science on this theory, but my ideas are more advanced than a popsci review of the subject could probably hold.   I'm too self-conscious to go fully woo 🔮😢</font>

<font size="5">I have invented a thing called "road empathy".   You just got to understand that everybody's in a hurry and they're late and they're trying to get somewhere and they're having a hard time.   When they drive like shit and you want to yell at them, just yell encouraging things</font>
