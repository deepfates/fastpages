<font size="5">if anyone could produce compelling evidence for the functionality of magic, there would be an incentiveto study it scientifically, and we might at least know what we don't know about it.   as it is, it all happens in your head.   prove me wrong, show me a magic</font>

<font size="5">Yes, we use imaginary models to explain how things work, even if those models are only somewhat accurate. it's fine to have a mental model, but it's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about Seeing Results</font>

<font size="5">magic, like synchronicity, happens at the intersection between your internal experience of reality and the external facts. if you're doing it right, things happen in your mind first and then happen in the real world. but there's no way to prove that to anyone</font>

<font size="5">i am actually well read in this subject. The problem with magic is not that it doesn't work. It's that if it does work, it's impossible to distinguish the magical effect from the other causal effects.</font>

<font size="5">it's a funny reply, but honestly Marianne Williamson is not doing very much to help make life multi-planetary and extend the light of consciousness to the stars.  at best, she's doing healing work on beings destined to die. more likely she's wireheading   https://t.co/hUZqI2pKpc</font>
