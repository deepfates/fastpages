<font size="5">it's funny, I grew up among all these progressive punk anarchist radical people, and I believed in their whole spiel. until I started trying to listen to Christian hip-hop. (which is better than punk music, on a musical level)  suddenly all the tolerance went out the window</font>

<font size="5">it wasn't even Christian hip-hop like how there's like a Christian metal scene. just regular hip hop, mainstream shit. and all of these tolerant white West Coast punks couldn't handle it.

<font size="5">stop taking your fucking shopping cart back to the store. Don't even put it in that little corral thing. You got to leave shopping carts all over the parking lot. the best part of working at a grocery store is collecting shopping carts, alone, in the parking lot. don't fuck it up</font>
