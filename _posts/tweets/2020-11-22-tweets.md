<font size="5">this is such a weird phrasing. i used to hear it all the time from "spiritual" yoga girls. "if it doesn't serve you, let it go"  i don't even like being served at a restaurant, how's a whole mythology supposed to serve me</font>

<font size="5">after some testing I realize that's it's main limitation: you can only copy the link, not click through to the tweet itself.   not that it's so hard to copy link, Paste and Go in browser. but this encourages the quote-tweet rather than the long-form thread</font>

<font size="5">is that more honest to real thought patterns? the thread for the in-moment train of thought, and the quote tweet to reference earlier thoughts?  or is it a temporary fix for a thorny UI problem</font>

<font size="5">okay, it's just an invisible distinction within the visual block of the tweet   https://t.co/SkZcyu3uB0  if it's supposed to fit in with twitter it just needs a 1px rounded button around it to break the symmetry.</font>

<font size="5">i can break a thread into two pieces. will twitter ever give me a way to visualize this natively? or will they give me voice tweets? no   i am given only fleets</font>

<font size="5">i think i like the thread helper, and it doesn't seem like it threatens twitter's "Now" business model, so it will probably survive. but surely they're considering building out a graph visualization, and i wonder how long twitter will let that fly. the graph is their moat</font>

<font size="5">The best way to know is not to read everything that is said or written, but to be aware of how little you are reading.   You're reading so much, it's hard to tell if you are getting a direct message or reading something else.</font>
