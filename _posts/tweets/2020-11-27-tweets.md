<font size="5">"... could not find evidence in data that syntax highlighting as used in Eclipse has a beneficial effect on program comprehension for programming novices."  " ... using more visual variety when rendering methods substantially reduces comprehension time of code features."  🤔</font>

<font size="5">this makes sense to me. i've tried multiple syntax schemes and prefer low-intensity highlighting. the especially exciting ones, like  https://t.co/ycCI6ocE1P, are actually a bit of a headache</font>

<font size="5">actually, anaglyph uses different font weights which is a suggestion in the above paper. but it's still highlighting syntax, rather than context  https://t.co/5Zcjid957n</font>

<font size="5">apparently i have to undergo "keyboard binding" to understand this editor. this sounds like a ritual initiation</font>

<font size="5">any reason why i can't just edit these keyboard bindings to work more like "normal" ones? other than Stallman worship?</font>

<font size="5">maybe so. the commands are compositional, like micro-Unix tools. Ctrl+U is the "repeat" prefix, so something like "Ctrl+U F 10" immediately prints FFFFFFFFFF at the location of your cursor. this is nifty</font>

<font size="5">perhaps my favorite thing so far is the built-in clipboard history. when you paste (or "yank" in Emacs parlance), you get the last thing you copied (or "killed"). But if you then follow Ctrl-Y with Alt-Y, you start cycling back through your previous kills. this is Way nifty</font>

<font size="5">major modes, minor modes. orchestral.   major modes analogous to apps or websites. you can only be using one at a time, they have different functions.  minor modes analogous to plugins or browser extensions. you toggle them on or off independently depending on what you need</font>

<font size="5">okay, i have finished the tutorial. i can see why people like this: a keyboard-first approach to navigating and manipulating text.  i'll give this a shot for a while. it's somewhere between a shell and an editor. maybe i'll learn something.  i am very interested in the Lisp way..</font>
