<font size="5">what i'm talking about is a social problem, not a technological one.  this is not something you need blockchains for. or VR, or AI. what you need is a *strange attractor*.   a flag, a mutual vision that draws together a disparate group of people. a swarm of squads</font>

<font size="5">and these are congregations! that strange attractor is an egregore. a little baby godling.  egregores want to help people get together and align their actions toward a greater goal. that's why we're symbiotic. but in return, we must build them somewhere to live</font>

<font size="5">this doesn't have to be a startup, or a co-op, or a communist revolution. there are internet subcultures who are able to divert a bunch of money and power into building their realities simply as users. i.e.: furries,  gamers, memers, tiktok dancers   https://t.co/CxdFNPhpqA</font>

<font size="5">i'm glad that people are building the financial and digital infrastructure for new egregores, outside of the current system of nations and corporations.   but ultimately what it will need is a level of ritual, personal devotion, and trust equal to a cult, or religion</font>

<font size="5">in a way this is the genius of the Constitution DAO. crowd-owning a sacred text will give purpose to all the people who participate, and a sense of unearned trust. the opposite of a secret society lol. you know these people share your values. literally!   https://t.co/QvSeqb4oDB</font>

<font size="5">i don't know if they'll be able to do it, especially if their buying power is visible on the blockchain. if they don't have 20 mil, they can't bluff their way to the top. and if they do, they can still be outbid. maybe they're planning some cool smart contract shit, idk</font>

<font size="5">i wouldn't join them anyway. i need a DAO that's producing things. in the real world, ideally, but software will be necessary as well. it doesn't have to collect things, it doesn't have to 1000x in value.  most people are sketched out by things that 1000x in value! they're risky!</font>

<font size="5">what i really want:   • steady, meaningful work to do  for • people I care about.   i have this now -- family business -- and it's great! but it isn't something that will scale. and i also want  • to build collective power around a communal vision to change the world</font>

<font size="5">i know what that vision is, for me. and i know a lot of people who agree with it!   but i don't know how to build a congregation around it. i don't have the tools, and i don't have the social finesse</font>

<font size="5">maybe i can focus on articulating a vision. other people can disagree with it, or build on top of it. either way it would be useful to have common frame of reference for discussion.  a lot of this stuff is nifty technologically, but not grounded in real people's needs</font>

<font size="5">how can i write a promising vision for the future without becoming a focal point for an egregore? i need to build it a virtual house, with a virtual name. like when Plato made up Socrates  otherwise this shit will get serious far too fast. as we have seen   https://t.co/9y9SVA6EyQ</font>

<font size="5">i guess the crux here is "actually important to do". assuming we have some amount of funds and labor, what is the most valuable thing to do with it? it has to be  something that pays back, at least enough to not deplete our funds and labor.   but it also has to have a purpose</font>

<font size="5">i've known people in the intentional communities scene for a decade. coming up with a communal purpose is hard. finding one that's also a successful business model? nearly impossible.  i guess the peanut butter factory does okay. but they're not scaling</font>

<font size="5">again, here, the middle stairs are missing. there are long term visions for humanity (already outlining the religious wars to come), and there are short-term strategies like "do a startup" "start a podcast" "pump a dog coin" "get foodies"  we need cathedrals to build</font>

<font size="5">not cathedrals of historic proportion. we should not build for the fortunes of families, or the armies of states, or the glory of old gods.  we should build cathedrals to Nature, without whom we would never have made it this far. and to Science, without which we won't make it out</font>

<font size="5">we probably need to return about 50% of the surface to biodiverse full-succession ecosystems (not sure how much of ocean). without killing a bunch of people, so we need to maintain/adapt technoindustrial cities to hold billions more people   is that vague   https://t.co/ce4WH2e5ei</font>

<font size="5">what we need are cathedrals to nature (rehabitats) and to science (arcologies). to steward the climate for the indefinite future. because A) nobody else is going to do it, and B) complex life unlikely to develop again if we kill it all!  it's a huge mission. where is quest giver?</font>

<font size="5">currently there are billions of people who would like to save the planet, very few people who will actively say that they want to kill the planet. a good number of people who say one but do the other.   unfortunately, the power is locked up by that last group</font>

<font size="5">power here meaning "ability to coordinate mass human behavior". states have it, religions have it, monied persons and corporations have it.   they can't get everybody to save the planet all at once either! they're caught in status games and multipolar traps.</font>
