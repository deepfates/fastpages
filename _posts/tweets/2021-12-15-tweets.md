<font size="5">few days my girlfriend is going to come home and everything is going to be beautiful. clean house, gifts under the tree, kitchen full of food. it's going to be great  then one of two things is going to happen: either she's going to figure out the salt is missing, or find the salt</font>

<font size="5">but df, you say, why not just get a new salt? You're stocking the kitchen anyway as you have said.  I noble idea. It will work for a while. then the old salt will finally show itself</font>

<font size="5">1/ This may not seem like a secret, but Amazon is the biggest bookseller in the world. Not just new books: something like 95% of used book traffic happens on Amazon marketplace.   (All numbers in this thread are either misremembered or made up, do not seek citations)</font>

<font size="5">2/ Amazon doesn't even make money from the books they sell. they sell their new titles at our below cost much of the time.  So as nice as it is that many people come in the bookstore and say "I didn't want to buy from the evil empire", it's not hurting Amazon at all</font>

<font size="5">3/ Amazon got it start with books, but now they make their money from selling "computer power". Do you know why Mr Jeff started with books though?  well, they're square. good for packaging. they each have a unique label. Good for inventory. and they're cheap to ship, Media Mail</font>

<font size="5">4/ unpopular opinion but I really should be doing some shelving right now. shelving is really important as it keeps the books easily accessed. If a person can't grab the book with a single finger they often just won't read it.  each shelf should have one book worth of empty space</font>

<font size="5">6/ well technically, since I don't want to take books from the to-be-shelved cart and find where they go, or re-alphabetize misplaced books, I won't be doing shelving.   instead I'll just make shelf have a correct looseness and straighten and dust them. We call this "fluffing"</font>

<font size="5">8/ Great question. In fact our local library sale bans electronics!   but the thrift stores have had the best stuff picked out. I seen teams, including a Mennonite woman with children, and a middle-aged guy who brings books to his handicapped mom to scan   https://t.co/5XKSFg2WxD</font>

<font size="5">9/ personally I don't care if book scanners want to take the used books that have already been picked over by the library or thrift store. they're not selling them cheap enough for the slow velocity with which they will sell.  used books are competitive market with low profits</font>

<font size="5">11/ books are bulky, heavy, non-fungible, and often emotionally charged.   People have trouble getting rid of books. They will literally give you their books for free.  although the better the book, the more likely they wants to get *something* for it..</font>

<font size="5">12/ I talked to a used bookseller in Pittsburgh who said he had dropped his prices to a dime in cash or a quarter in store credit and people didn't bat an eye.   I still give $1-3 in credit, which feels like a bad deal for me half the time but a bad deal for you the other half.🤷🏼</font>

<font size="5">13/ used or new, selling books in a brick and mortar store is all about your shelf space. shelves are finite, no matter how big and cheap your space.  shows are your bottleneck. oh wait I'm supposed to be shelving</font>

<font size="5">14/ One strategy is to maximize individual book value. This is your rare and used book seller, where each book might cost between 50 and a million bucks. so it's okay if they sit on the shelf for a long time before selling</font>

<font size="5">15/ The other way is to maximize turnover. stock the best selling books and so each one multiple times in a year. This is the strategy that new bookstores take, of course. it's easier when you can get more copies on demand</font>

<font size="5">16/ the traditional used bookstore model tries to maximize individual book margin by paying little to nothing her book, and selling the books cheap enough that they still move Out the door.  but this leaves the worst books on the shelf. You can't restock the ones that sell</font>

<font size="5">17/ We now use a hybrid model, where we stock used and new next to each other.   This model was pioneered by Powell's. it allows for a good combination of serendipity and reliable inventory. We have to be pickier about used books now though, if they're to compare to new copies</font>

<font size="5">21/ as far as i can tell, people use book scanners to tell them which books will sell on Amazon. not for a whole lot, necessarily. i believe they aim for high-velocity books, which means looking for books with a high Amazon sales rank.   Shelf limit again   https://t.co/uijKVPKoo1</font>

<font size="5">for anyone who's still clicking on this, it was a bit of satire. obviously true cost should be calculated at the manufacturer, and those costs should be passed on to the consumer unwillingly. so they don't have the option to dump the trash illegally, because you know they will</font>

<font size="5">22/ Online sales are only a small fraction of my business, but probably the majority of book selling businesses out there are online-only. They'll have a garage, or a storage unit, or a warehouse, and list their inventory with online markets. Storefronts are expensive</font>

<font size="5">23/ The way brick-and-mortar bookstores afford their storefront space is by providing something other than the literal books.   If you can get a used book for $4 from a scanner with a garage, or a new one for 60% of the cover price from Amazon, why would you pay more for mine?</font>

<font size="5">24/ Part of what we provide is a sense of moral good. Spend your money here to support local, and defeat the Evil Amazonian Empire! And that's sweet: people are paying more to feel good about themselves and their community.  but as a Rebel Alliance we lack strategy and resources</font>

<font size="5">25/ So we're not going to actually defeat Amazon. They're the Everything Store now, plus thye have "Computer Power". They could stop selling books right now and not notice. But they won't, becuase... everything store.  Bookstores have to be valuable as an end in themselves</font>

<font size="5">26/ So bookstores need to have the books people want, but they also need something else. A coffee shop, or bar maybe. Event space and a constant slate of events. A political angle, perhaps (tho these seem to chronically underestimate the value of selling the books people want)</font>

We held a ton of events (before covid) for local authors and poets, building goodwill in that community.  I'm not sure that the local books will ever turn a profit. But those authors buy books 🤑</font>

<font size="5">29/ Bookstores are romantic. I see a lot of dates. (They don't buy much)  I actually met my gf in the bookstore. She walked in and I neurotically reshelved books until she talked to me. Then she stumbled on her words and we introduced ourselves and shook hands. thne she left</font>

<font size="5">33/ My gf is one of those people who actively destroys a book by reading it. She folds the front cover around to the back. She sets it face down wide open.
