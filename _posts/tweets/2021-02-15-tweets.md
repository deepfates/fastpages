<font size="5">this guide  https://t.co/EIdpj41a7J is where I'm staying, for getting the OS onto the machine.   it starts with editing the partition table on the SD card. with `fdisk` 😅</font>

<font size="5">I think this is because I installed the 64-bit version of Arch. apparently there's a bunch of closed-source Pi-specific code in the 32-bit version, i'll try that</font>

<font size="5">i have now added a user, created the `sudo` group and given sudoers permissions. this means that I can do root commands for my user account, without the dangers of logging into root.   you have to use vi to edit the sudo file. only took me three tries and one reboot to exit</font>

<font size="5">I'm gonna try to use wayland. not for the meme but for graphics capabilities! it apparently uses the lil GPU a lot better than X.  Enlightenment has some kind of Wayland support so I'm trying that for now. tiling managers maybe later</font>
