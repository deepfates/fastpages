<font size="5">Rightoids think that Biden stole the election. Leftoids think that Trump stole the previous election.   Neither of those are particularly true, but they sure do keep people glued to the TV</font>

<font size="5">Good reply game here. yet I want to point out that people who "followed the situation closely" had the most exposure to memes about that situation And probably stronger algorithmic filter bubbles shaping which information they're exposed to    https://t.co/M5IRxACidA</font>

<font size="5">i just don't think that people are really influenced by theology that much. i think they backfit theologies to justify the strategies they've found to meet those needs.   those strategies are inherenltly local maxima, and most strategies don't involve an explicit maximizing step</font>

<font size="5">Like here's this creature, they're not very fast or sharp or stealthy, they're pretty stupid alone.   yet they go anywhere they want, and through vibrating sounds at each other they are able to coordinate to transform every landscape into their hive.

<font size="5">You think you can just avoid them, but everywhere you go there are more of them setting up their weird nests.   And they make traps! Their environments are like dwarf fortresses, designed to capture and process you. bones and all  they turn everything into part of themselves</font>
