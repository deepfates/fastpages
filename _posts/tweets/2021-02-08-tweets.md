<font size="5">this article from 2018 has the price forecasts of  https://t.co/Arhjdaj7yK for later that year, and for last month. both are spot on.  if you believe their currnt predictions, BTC and ETH will double by the end of the year and then go sideways for a while. few coins will beat that</font>

<font size="5">my investment advice: buy something, get scared, sell it for a loss. find something else, luck out, get scared, sell way you early. age. wake up at 3am every day, remain in a constant state of panic, obsessively watch the line go 📈📉 on your phone.   this will make you happy</font>
