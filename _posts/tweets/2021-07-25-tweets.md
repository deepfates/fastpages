<font size="5">Not trying to dunk on this dude, he's just doing engagement bait and research for his podcast. but I'm pretty sure when I read a self-help book I'm doing it a favor, not the other way around</font>

<font size="5">got to say the covid fitness program has been pretty incredible.  I've done nothing but sit, eat, and Twitter for over a year now, but I've both cut muscle and gained pounds!  I can see my ribs right above my love handles it's crazy</font>

<font size="5">I wish I could teach a class at the local university on, like, Casual Computer Programming for Normal People.  Just like a simple introduction to markdown, python, notebooks and APIs. could do the entire thing in Colab. It would empower people.  why they don't have this already?</font>

<font size="5">part of the fantasy of teaching it at a college is that students, whether young ones or adult head, could automate a lot of the bullshit work their ass to do. And it wouldn't be some self-selecting online course for people with too much money and free time, jus a regular class</font>

<font size="5">a lot of people think you need to be good at math to do programming. but it's not really true. Not any more than to use recipes, or knitting patterns.  programming is very little about math, and almost entirely about breaking problems into small steps!   https://t.co/I5KvMewHdi</font>

<font size="5">The other thing about programming is, a lot of that computer science stuff is low-level c code or object-oriented Java monstrosities. but with the advent of prompt engineering, a lot of people's computer use will be just loading up a model and then typing English into it</font>
