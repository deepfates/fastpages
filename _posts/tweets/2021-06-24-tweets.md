<font size="5">it's a good point, social media creates these dynamics institutionally. in the same way that high school does, i guess: we're all in here together, forced to differentiate ourselves in the popularity contest without the ability to use physical force. SimClusters are cliques even</font>

<font size="5">The meme to virus analogy is a mistake though. memes are like genes, memeplexes organisms. they're not just hijacking your communication to reproduce. You are their substrate.   The collection of memes in your mind is more like the microbiome in your gut   https://t.co/RSUQsAk8Cg</font>

<font size="5">it's funny, cuz Anathem does have a real slow start and a lot of people can't get past the first hundred pages of world building. but I got sucked into it.  whereas Snow Crash, the first two pages are so juvenile that it took me five tries to get to page 3. where the punchline is</font>
