<font size="5">blocks, or tweets, are little units of thought. You should be able to do more with them than string them on thread or graph them.  they should graph themswlves</font>

<font size="5">What if the "desktop" were like a frame held underwater, and you could move it up and down to intersect different areas of your notes?  The notes could sink or float based on size, complexity, frequency or recency of use...  a third dimension   https://t.co/MIqHdaIm19</font>

<font size="5">And maybe the notes would sort themselves in the x and y axes based on semantic similarity.   And if you regrouped them, maybe it would retrain your clustering algorithms so that it simulates your groups better next time  groping for thoughts in a wishing well, stirring them up</font>

<font size="5">You could link groups of blocks together for working on essays or code. Like workspaces. but maybe you would have a maximum width, axis, so workspaces would stack at the top of the well. to switch workspaces you could push The whole blob down and another would surface</font>

<font size="5">This is the first I've seen someone try to flesh out the virtual library concept in a way that isn't just skeuomorphic.  The problem with this geomorphic approach, of course, is it reduces the information density compared to text  imagery might solve this   https://t.co/7JgZtnuRp1</font>
