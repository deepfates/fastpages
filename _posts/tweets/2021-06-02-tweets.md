<font size="5">gf assures me that most people don't have a million things they want to create. that I'm blessed to be so be driven.   that's nice way to think about it. sometimes it feels like a curse. like I'm compelled to ignore all the joys of life in favor of bringing a monster to life</font>

<font size="5">sometimes i wish i could just enjoy my life. i feel so much pressure: to create, to build the things i imagine. i feel like there's not enough time: in the day, the week, the weekends. in my life.   i don't understand how people just... consume experiences</font>

<font size="5">maybe humans are programmed to have FOMO. we're social animals, right? important not to miss out on what the tribe is up to.  i need a word for the opposite of FOMO: when you know you're missing out, but the thing you're doing is more important than the one you're missing</font>

<font size="5">i have enjoyed life. i spent my 20s following my friends around: traveling, hanging out, playing music, swimming and hiking. it was fun.  but where did it lead? where are those people now? mostly working shitty jobs to pay the bills so they can continue to consume experiences</font>

<font size="5">pretty brave of Kanye to make a gospel song featuring both Kenny G and The Beep From When You Leave Your Keys In The Car. neither of whom had really done gospel before as far as I know</font>
