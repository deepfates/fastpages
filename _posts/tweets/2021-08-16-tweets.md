<font size="5">trying to refactor this VQGAN+CLIP notebook so it can be better automated. It's helping me understand the internals a lot better, but it can be so frustrating when i don't understand.  there's a global that's being updated deep inside a nested function. why. how do i replace it</font>

<font size="5">it's because the MSE update process is wrapped inside the ascend_txt function? i think?  the notebook is a huge structural blob with hidden globals and tons of mutated variables. i really want it to be more functional</font>
