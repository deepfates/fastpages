<font size="5">Incredibly concentrated dose of hacker news energy in these three comments. The second one is grayed out because it has been downvoted so much 😅  This is the orangepill  https://t.co/uTqMKJ7e5J</font>

<font size="5">this went pretty well btw. I talked to my friend for a couple hours on the phone, didn't tell her what to do, just ask her about her reasoning process in deciding whether or not to get it.   it sounded like everyone else she had talked to had a high opinion of their own opinion</font>

<font size="5">but my attitude about it is, billions of really smart people are looking at this, and they decided to take this vaccine. why would I think I'm a better judge of the data than literal vaccine scientists?</font>

<font size="5">I guess I could ask my friends.   I could ask the guy that used to keep gold sewn into the cuffs of his overalls  I could ask the guy who had lice for 6 months while using "natural methods" to kill lice  I could ask the guy who has been trading cryptocurrency on leverage</font>

<font size="5">if people think that other humans project a force from their eyes, you can act as if you actually do this. and it will become socially real</font>

<font size="5">i'm trying to use this after Twitter finally gave me my archive. but there seems to be a mystery step where it actually unfollows users?   it asks if you want to unfollow, then uses a prompt_boolean() function that literally just returns a boolean. but they get unfollowed? wtf</font>
