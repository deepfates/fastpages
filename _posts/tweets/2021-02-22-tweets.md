<font size="5">Back to this. I looked it up and there are like four used copies and one new on the internet. for prices between $200 and $2000. I don't know what year it was when I looked up the $4K price -- 2015? I read it originally when I lived in Portland in 2011.</font>

<font size="5">why did they have this book at the Portland Community College Library (Sylvania Campus)? nobody there could tell me. presumably someone needed it once and they ordered a copy? or maybe R. Kirk Packwood went to PCC lol</font>

<font size="5">who is he? nobody knows. Google thinks it's this guy they scraped from a funeral website, but Goodreads has a book by Packwood about the summoning of Kek, so he had to be alive in 2016 right?  https://t.co/lDJ31UMK9J</font>

<font size="5">For example, one year someone at the community house decided to undergo the Abramelin working. this is an old and extremely powerful magical initiation that takes at least six months of intense prayer and ascetic living. Purpose to contact your Holy Guardian Angel or HGA</font>

<font size="5">okay when I said this book changed my life, that has to be considered in context: I was, at the time, a practicing chaos magician involved with a weird cult of anarchists and Thelemites. i didn't realize the danger I was in.</font>

<font size="5">he prepared all the tools, built a "temple" out of white sheets in the dark basement. a couple days before he had planned to embark, he told us all that something had happened:   his Holy Guardian Angel had contacted him and told him he could skip the whole process! 😈</font>

<font size="5">Now, to be fair, this is what's supposed to happen! The HGA is a voice in your mind that gives you perfect wise advice. Like the logoplasm that contacted PKD (or Jiminy Cricket for Pinocchio). IMO it's your perfected future self contacting you mentally but what do i know</font>

<font size="5">I tried to explain this at the time. even the power-tripping cult leader guy was sketched out by it (i think this was mostly like "hey, I choose which demons possess my minions" unfortunately). but the kid was pleased with himself and he scrapped the project</font>

<font size="5">HOWEVER!  the HGA is not the ONLY possible explanation for a voice in your head!  this guy was young, ambitious, and weak. the perfect target</font>

<font size="5">so this was the type of magical hazard I was exposed to. I don't know whether the Pied Piper cult guy had anything to do with that specific demon, but he definitely had a habit of keeping schizophrenics around as channels. i tried to rescue them but eventually i had to get out 😰</font>

<font size="5">Finally they managed to subdue him and called the cops I guess. 51/50ed him. committed involuntarily to a mental hospital. I never saw him again, though I heard he came out eventually and seemed to be okay.</font>

<font size="5">I wasn't there but I had to come over and help clean up the mess afterward. It started with howling, in the middle of the night, just unending wails. they tried to shush him and he started running around grabbing up kitchen knives and things and trying to carve himself apart.</font>

<font size="5">Over the winter he fell into a deep depression. Just laying on the couch 24/7, curled up into a deep dark ball of bitterness and hatred. I literally stopped going over there because his bad energy was suffusing all three floors of the building.  then one day he snapped.</font>

<font size="5">That was the environment I was in when I read Memetic Magic. And around the same time I read a book called The War in Heaven, by Kyle Griffith.   These two are inextricably linked in my mind as they both discuss the same topic: people, and beings, that subsist on psychic energy</font>

<font size="5">Obviously these books are wackadoo! They are the ravings of madmen, surely. Lots of pseudoscience on exhibit, not to mention space people and Illuminati and psychic vampires. But with my background in memetics and a chaote's knack for arbitrary belief, I began to see in it Truth</font>

<font size="5">man, I forgot how fucked up this book is. Very Nietzschean worldview, Human Royalty above the lowly sheeple type beat. gross. I don't mean to say I agree with its values, I just saw people who did, and who used its techniques to prey on others. "psychic vampires" in a sense</font>

<font size="5">in contrast, The War in Heaven battles against this type of individual.   in Griffith's ontology these are called Theocrats, and they attach themselves to other people's psychic energy so that they will live on after death. those who oppose them are the Invisible College</font>

<font size="5">Theocrats actually are spirits who refuse to reincarnate and instead prey on other spirits and living people. they try to trap you into their Fundamentalist groups to keep you around so they can absorb your soul into their fake Heaven when you die. 😬  https://t.co/n6AazpcVSM</font>
