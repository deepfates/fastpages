<font size="5">contrast to the previous "evil serif" font, this one is a humanist serif which is a very modern look. Really only preceded by Lydian Bold, aka the Nancy Drew font, which is also everywhere now  https://t.co/jZsYKvPhyE</font>

<font size="5">here's Lydian bold now in fact! I love the colored text on colored background, and the red foil title lettering that catches the light  https://t.co/PluhwGJIl2</font>

<font size="5">the new Emily St John Mandel book has a more subtle font choice, sans serif but with humanist touches instead of the geometric trend of the 2010s. also uses a silver glitter effect that's rather unique  https://t.co/NWyDNkNj6Z</font>

<font size="5">I love these bold colors and graphical designs. contrast with the "movie poster" cover designs of the 2010s, which would have a sans serif font center-aligned over photorealist imagery.  also notice the step-back covers. used to fit more marketing crap but a nice splash of color  https://t.co/WfTrjWOrjt</font>

<font size="5">oh I meant humanist sans-serif* here whoops. humanist serifs are very common, because traditional handwriting use serifs, but sans were invented in the 20th century as part of a modernist, mechanical look And have mostly been geometric   https://t.co/fxlYnbaaPq</font>
