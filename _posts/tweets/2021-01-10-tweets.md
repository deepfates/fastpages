<font size="5">smoking indoors with books is like smoking indoors with children. it's wrong and you shouldn't do it, but nobody will know, so you can get away with it.  and like with children, as soon as you let on that you're doing it, you should have them taken away from you</font>

<font size="5">The whole point of writing a book is that your reader follows you through your argument and is persuaded by your rhetoric. if you just let them wander around in a heap of notes they're going to think whatever the hell they want.   worse, they're never going to read it at all</font>
