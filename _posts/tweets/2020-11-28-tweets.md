<font size="5">so I REALIZED after staying up reading about Emacs and Lisp and Clojure til well past 3 in the morning...  Emacs is not just "somewhere between a shell and an editor". It's way more than that</font>

<font size="5">this means that it's not just another text editor with a bunch of plugins. it's an interactive programming environment attached to a keyboard, so each keystroke executes a different function. it turns your keyboard into a Turing machine.  it's a nonlinear REPL</font>

<font size="5">rather than being in back-and-forth conversation with the Read-Eval-Print Loop, you're in a universe of functions made up of other functions. if you press M-x (M is Meta, aka Alt or Opt) you can call any function by its full name, like a command line. But it's so much more</font>
