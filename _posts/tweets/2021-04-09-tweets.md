<font size="5">Why does matrix vector product work so well for finding similarity between the text features and the image features in clip embeddings? compared to K nearest neighbors, which works great for finding image features that are similar to other image features but doesn't work for text</font>

<font size="5">it's also much faster to load once cached. sucks to take 2.5 minutes to process and index 26,000 images, but you only have to do it once (unless you add or remove from the dataset lol)</font>

<font size="5">over a 50 image dataset, Annoy is 3x slower building the index, and equal or slower on inference.  over a 6,000 image dataset, it's 2x slower building index but over 30x faster at inf.  over a 26,000 image dataset: 5x slower to build, but over 100x faster to infer! 50ms to 7secs!</font>
