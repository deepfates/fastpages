<font size="5">last night got a new toy. between trying out all the built-in sounds, getting my laptop ALSA and Jack and pulseaudio to work together or at least not get in each other's way, and learning live looping software, i didn't look at Twitter for 5 hours.  also didn't look at gf tho  https://t.co/hdZnSQgfUp</font>

<font size="5">This was literally a subtweet of one specific guy that I was watching in the parking lot at that moment. if you take it any further than that is your own problem.   I muted this thread long ago, don't follow me, I'm invisible</font>

<font size="5">most people's pfps are just abstract shapes to me. like no offense but i do not click through to find out what it looks like up close.   if it don't read at 1/4" you're just a color blob and tbh that's on you</font>

<font size="5">This is similar to the other effect, where any given persons profile reads like a bot if you don't know that they're a real person.   This whole place could be fake for all I know. maybe everybody experiences a totally different Twitter and none of them are actually connected</font>
