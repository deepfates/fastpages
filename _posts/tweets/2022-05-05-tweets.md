<font size="5">I like when I post a subtweet about someone and they post a sub tweet about unfollowing me the next morning. That means you been stewing on it all night.   I don't even remember your name by afternoon</font>

<font size="5">really, all i need is a chart that compares number cases to number of deaths. rolling averages would be better, but i'm looking for some kind of measure of IFR. you can get any chart except for this</font>

<font size="5">i know that number of cases recorded is much smaller than the actual number, with asymptomatic cases and home testing etc. i don't care! that just makes the IFR even smaller than it looks like.    i just want a trend line of "how fatal is COVID". can't get it for love or money</font>

<font size="5">okay I don't understand why these two pages are different but this one actually goes through to May 2022. And maps to my idea of the actual risk of death from this disease over time, given vaccinations etc. CFR is not IFR but better than nothing   https://t.co/QJ69FfeA0A</font>
