<font size="5">there's a popular belief that goes something like:  🗣️ "Things are very bad in the world and you personally have the power to stop them! and if you don't try, you're complicit in the badness!"  and i just don't think the evidence supports it</font>

<font size="5">let's set the scene:  I lived at a remote wilderness commune for three years. I don't want to say which one, because i  don't want to attract the attention of its egregore.  if you know the names of several communes in the USA, this is likely to be one of them</font>

<font size="5">once you get there, you find an 1800s ghost town that was renovated by hippies in the 1960s and upgraded by anarchists in the 2010s. it's a mishmash of ancient wood construction, microhydro power, goats, 5mil plastic greenhouse, greenhouse made from old windows. v "solarpunk"</font>

<font size="5">the reason it's on my mind this morning (aside from the number of mutuals talking about starting intentional communities) is that we used to have the dreaded "SUNDAY MEETING"  this was officially NOT RELIGIOUS but in reality it felt VERY RELIGIOUS</font>

<font size="5">some of the most evil people I've known have also had the worst posture, teeth, physical degradation in general.  i'm not saying that physical degradation only happens because of evil. obviously poverty, disability, bad luck &amp;c could cause.  but does being evil destroy your body?</font>

<font size="5">SUNDAY MEETING was a tradition since the 60s, even though no one had been there that long. It was held irregularly, often on Sundays but not every Sunday. I don't know exactly what it was like early on, although as the self-appointed librarian i did read the old meeting notes.</font>

<font size="5">what it was like in the 10s was a horizontal consensus circle with a stack. think 🏴,🌈,🇴​🇨​🇨​🇺​🇵​🇾​. we go around and check-in with each person, then the Facilitator goes through the Agenda and the Stack Taker keeps track of who gets to talk next. FIFO model</font>

<font size="5">whenever the old hippies came around, the "Greater Family", they would revert to the old model where you pass a "feather" (problematic) or a "talking stick" (not better) around the circle and each person would share their "heartsong" (right?) on whatever the topic of the moment</font>

<font size="5">both of these meeting styles, despite their egalitarian rationale, were very contrived and artifical. they would fail anytime something controversial came up, because people would revert to domination tactics of various flavors. emotional displays, poker-faced scheming, nemawashi</font>

<font size="5">as in many cases, infrastructure defines superstructure. there were only so many Cabins at this place, and you couldn't build any more because then the Land Assessors would come out to assess it. and then they would notice that people were living in these "outbuildings"</font>

<font size="5">so we only had a few Cabins. and because of the steep valley fork we were in, there were only so many good flat spots to build a Cabin. so they were spread out in two directions at distances of up to a mile and climbs up to 700' from the "Main House".</font>

<font size="5">this is an excellent question!  it turns out, there were many different reasons that people were there. but because we didn't have a nuanced language to talk about that, those distinctions didn't really come up until it was too late and the ad-hoc social cohesion would shatter</font>

<font size="5">speaking of dogs. we were supposedly a Goat Ranch because we had the infrastructure for Goat Milking and Storage. the Goat Committee would take the goats for Goat Walks. there was a Goat Manager  we had roughly 8 to 16 goats at any given time. but at one point we had OVER 25 DOGS</font>

<font size="5">and there was no Dog Manager. each person would manage their own dog to their own criteria, adjusted by arguments with other dog owners and various treaties decided by internal dog politics.  non-dog people (like me) were considered to not have skin in the game, and ignored</font>

<font size="5">oh also we had like 30 chickens and somebody would have to feed them and (infrequently) muck out the coop. but they were all old, and no one was allowed to kill them , so we got like 3 eggs a day. and those would be earmarked for baking or for whichever babies were on the ranch</font>

<font size="5">why we weren't allowed to kill them? I HAVE NO IDEA.   some weird ideology or another was the rationale, but ultimately it was about power politics. several groups were attempting to "vibe out" the other groups and take over the ranch for their friends</font>

<font size="5">none of these forms were chosen democratically. they were all formed by strong-willed people, deciding on an arbitrary structure that "the people" must use to enact "the people's will". the democratic or horizontal structure continued to exist because it was a convenient front</font>

<font size="5">as different strong-willed people cycled through the place, the direction and intention of the community would change. which, cool, better to adapt than to stagnate. but the lessons learned didn't percolate back into the "Traditional Guidelines", so the same problems would repeat</font>
