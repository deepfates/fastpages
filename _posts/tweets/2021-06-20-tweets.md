<font size="5">it's important to remember that the follower number isn't a sign of virtue. In fact if anything you have to be kind of depraved to attract a large Twitter following</font>

<font size="5">if somebody's main compulsion is to tweet all day, that's fine. I like that. if you're here to talk with your friends and maintain a high engagement, low follower lifestyle. That's great. but if you're here to build an audience you're probably a bit psycho  (it's me, I'm psycho)</font>

<font size="5">because there's a feedback loop between the things you tweet, and the follower number. People treat you a certain way based on whether you fit the character they perceive you as.   And you can scale to a lot of people with a relatively small, tight "message" or "bit" or "angle"</font>

<font size="5">it's like a GAN. You try to generate tweets that your character would tweet, and people rate you on how good they are. And they're always introducing new training data and moving the goal posts, so you can never fully succeed.  And most people mode collapse</font>

<font size="5">CLIP is trying to use the half size floating point numbers, FP16, which improves performance if you have a GPU. The JIT is part of the torch script interpreter that makes that conversion.   turning it off runs everything in FP32, but they actually admit performance is no worse 🤷🏼‍♂️</font>

<font size="5">Twitter will give you 2 minutes and 20 seconds of video in one tweet. That's enough time to do a song, or part of the song. And if i could just play the song out of the speaker, and record myself singing into the speaker, then I can multitrack it.   or you could. we could collab</font>
