<font size="5">it still takes too long (over a minute to search 57,000 images) but it is very fun to play with.   also it seems to be showing some world knowledge as well as OCR 🤔  https://t.co/lzeMAL9Mxb</font>

<font size="5">i figured out why memery was taking so long to search over pre-indexed images. i had written a list comprehension to unpack the archive in the proper ranked order.   but it was actually walking over a giant nested dictionary once for each item in the ranked list. rookie maneuver</font>

<font size="5">i have modified the archive dictionary so the keys are positive integers instead of unique string IDs. this allows me to pull the ranked indices by key, instead of walking the dictionary looking for an "index" value.  all because Annoy only takes integers as indexes 😅</font>

<font size="5">not sure if i somehow fcked up the indexer now, or if it's just taking a long time for this dataset because it's on an external hard drive. it's USB 3.0 it shouldn't be a file transfer bottleneck right?</font>

<font size="5">i fixed the ranker!!  it's still taking a long time to index (need to optimize for hardware) but searching seems to be lot better. now only takes .05 seconds for 57,000 images instead of 2-4 MINUTES like before!!   https://t.co/oYYUN5m9Rj</font>

<font size="5">unified meme theory states that the "meme", defined as the transmissible unit of human thought, and defined has a picture with some words on it that gets copied on the internet, are not different.   https://t.co/tkLy9gSydI</font>

<font size="5">a meme is picture+words because it represents a gradient in semantic space</font>

<font size="5">semantic space is a much-theorized "embedding" for language concepts. Like if you think about a chair, and then you think about a chaise, and then you think about a silla... there's a region in semantic space that activates from all of those. in your mind and mine</font>

<font size="5">the image provides a field, an area in semantic space. the words provide a vector. Your attention moves to that area of semantic space, and then updates in the direction that the vector points. a gradient in semantic space.</font>

#### <a href = "https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1397039126965223430">*21:57:38*</a>

<font size="5">depending on how far the words send you, and how well developed your map of that semantic space, either it lands or it doesn't. if it works on you, you save it to send it to someone else later.   showed this one to gf, she made me send it to her so she can send it to her dad  https://t.co/FP0UycuNmF</font>

<font size="5">but it has to be the right person: you have to simulate their whole mental state to understand whether this gradient will work on them. so memes follow social topologies as well.  this makes sense, though: semantic space is a product of social animals using mimetic calls</font>

<font size="5">CLIP encodes visual image and text about that image into the same embedding space. You've probably seen this image, maybe with a caption that says "AI is too dumb to tell the difference between an apple and an iPod lol"  but this is actually amazing  https://t.co/upCTu9OQJV</font>

<font size="5">The fact that CLIP can recognize letters in photographs Is a sign that they're encoded in the brain the same way as other visual data. they're just a bunch of weird squiggles, but they cause the meaning of the image to change.   in predictable ways!</font>

<font size="5">This neural net learned to read. It learned to read handwriting! it's not very good at it, but it wasn't trained to do that. it was trained to match flashcards of images to text captions.  Is this not mostly a picture that says iPod? with a hint of apple and a dash of wood fence</font>

<font size="5">there's a high dimensional space representing all these concepts and how they interact.  Your brain evolved to think about how other monkeys think about other other monkeys. CLIP is trained on contrastive pretraining objective. we are kinda the same   https://t.co/u7nB0l0gYz</font>
