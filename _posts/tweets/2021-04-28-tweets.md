<font size="5">looking back I can see obvious chapters in my life. periods where I was trying out a certain mindset or lifestyle, learned about it, and moved on from it for whatever reason.  thinking of them like D&amp;D class levels, i think i have six over the last 16 years.

<font size="5">yesterday a real tall stoned looking dude come in my bookstore. he saw our magic books through the window and had to compliment them.  "Do you even know what you have here?" he said. "This is the Real Shit right here. What is this, an arms dealership?"</font>

<font size="5">I imagine you could live a long time without ever leveling up. Like if you just did what you were told, and it didn't learn anything from it? or you can level up real fast all of a sudden.  most of my levels took about 3 years. how many do you have? how long did they take</font>

<font size="5">obviously some part of you childhood is not levels, it's just getting your level 0 Human abilities. I imagine you could start leveling at any age. many people don't start leveling till college. I spent my high school years fucking around and finding out, so I got level1 before 18</font>

<font size="5">it's funny, you can tell if a person has heroic levels. there's just a look about them. People have talked about this in many ways. The mark of Cain, for example, in Demian. or how Harry Potter has a scar from getting his first heroic level at 1-year-old</font>
