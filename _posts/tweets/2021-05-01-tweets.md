<font size="5">Now that I'm thinking about it though, the time loop only lasts a month. and the lich shows up in the first iteration. if there is a third time traveler, they might not be the lich actually</font>

<font size="5">but this is hard to confirm – cranium rat hive minds are very alien in their thinking, and find humans just as bizarre, making communication difficult. Regardless, the average swarm is clearly comparable to a human in intelligence.</font>

<font size="5">There is a limit, however, and a swarm that gets too big will eventually splinter into two or more smaller swarms, each with their own hive mind. It is rumored that bigger swarms are frighteningly intelligent, far outstripping the thinking power of a single human being</font>

<font size="5">All individual cranium rats are telepathically connected into a single shared consciousness. The more rats there are in a swarm, the more intelligent the shared hive mind becomes.</font>
