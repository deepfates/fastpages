I seen teams, including a Mennonite woman with children, and a middle-aged guy who brings books to his handicapped mom to scan https://t.co/5XKSFg2WxD 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 23 . . 15:32:24 . 9/ personally I don&#39;t care if book scanners want to take the used books that have already been picked over by the library or thrift store. they&#39;re not selling them cheap enough for the slow velocity with which they will sell. used books are competitive market with low profits 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 15:33:33 . 10/ Mr Jeff also knew that most books only sell once a year, and it&#39;s a lot cheaper to keep those books in a warehouse than on a shop floor with location location location https://t.co/xo58k5Ni5C 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 15:38:41 . 11/ books are bulky, heavy, non-fungible, and often emotionally charged. People have trouble getting rid of books. They will literally give you their books for free. although the better the book, the more likely they wants to get *something* for it.. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 23 . . 15:40:48 . 12/ I talked to a used bookseller in Pittsburgh who said he had dropped his prices to a dime in cash or a quarter in store credit and people didn&#39;t bat an eye. I still give $1-3 in credit, which feels like a bad deal for me half the time but a bad deal for you the other half.🤷🏼 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 17 . . 15:42:38 . 13/ used or new, selling books in a brick and mortar store is all about your shelf space. shelves are finite, no matter how big and cheap your space. shows are your bottleneck. oh wait I&#39;m supposed to be shelving 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 20 . . 16:12:36 . Just saw Pete Davidson holding hands with a guy who looked a lot like Tony Hawk. But it wasn&#39;t Tony Hawk 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 8 . . 16:27:31 . 14/ One strategy is to maximize individual book value. This is your rare and used book seller, where each book might cost between 50 and a million bucks. so it&#39;s okay if they sit on the shelf for a long time before selling 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 17 . . 16:28:49 . 15/ The other way is to maximize turnover. stock the best selling books and so each one multiple times in a year. This is the strategy that new bookstores take, of course. it&#39;s easier when you can get more copies on demand 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 16 . . 16:30:47 . 16/ the traditional used bookstore model tries to maximize individual book margin by paying little to nothing her book, and selling the books cheap enough that they still move Out the door. but this leaves the worst books on the shelf. You can&#39;t restock the ones that sell 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 17 . . 16:32:43 . 17/ We now use a hybrid model, where we stock used and new next to each other. This model was pioneered by Powell&#39;s. it allows for a good combination of serendipity and reliable inventory. We have to be pickier about used books now though, if they&#39;re to compare to new copies 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 21 . . 17:00:24 . 18/ I only wish we had this capacity to supply people this way. Powell&#39;s has dozens of rooms over four floors. Our little storefront is the size of maybe one room. we can shelve about 10,000. my mission is to make sure they&#39;re the right ones https://t.co/nhXQtzGD2S 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 21 . . 17:24:34 . 19/ My relationship to books is now like my relationship to cryptocurrencies. I judge each book by if it has a cool name or cover art, then keep trying to buy and sell it until it stops making me money https://t.co/DDgRj5VSl6 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 27 . . 17:29:48 . 20/ Really, i don&#39;t read that many books anymore. I find it hard to finish them. I start a lot of books though. I am addicted to Twitter so 🥲 maybe that&#39;s why i just shuffle books through my hands all day 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 19:01:05 . oh jeez only 43 more to go, hope people stop clicking on this haha 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 15 . . 19:03:52 . 21/ as far as i can tell, people use book scanners to tell them which books will sell on Amazon. not for a whole lot, necessarily. i believe they aim for high-velocity books, which means looking for books with a high Amazon sales rank. Shelf limit again https://t.co/uijKVPKoo1 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 12 . . 19:10:28 . for anyone who&#39;s still clicking on this, it was a bit of satire. obviously true cost should be calculated at the manufacturer, and those costs should be passed on to the consumer unwillingly. so they don&#39;t have the option to dump the trash illegally, because you know they will 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 13 . . 19:11:43 . 22/ Online sales are only a small fraction of my business, but probably the majority of book selling businesses out there are online-only. They&#39;ll have a garage, or a storage unit, or a warehouse, and list their inventory with online markets. Storefronts are expensive 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 11 . . 19:13:29 . 23/ The way brick-and-mortar bookstores afford their storefront space is by providing something other than the literal books. If you can get a used book for $4 from a scanner with a garage, or a new one for 60% of the cover price from Amazon, why would you pay more for mine? 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 14 . . 19:16:11 . 24/ Part of what we provide is a sense of moral good. Spend your money here to support local, and defeat the Evil Amazonian Empire! And that&#39;s sweet: people are paying more to feel good about themselves and their community. but as a Rebel Alliance we lack strategy and resources 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 19 . . 19:17:59 . 25/ So we&#39;re not going to actually defeat Amazon. They&#39;re the Everything Store now, plus thye have &quot;Computer Power&quot;. They could stop selling books right now and not notice. But they won&#39;t, becuase... everything store. Bookstores have to be valuable as an end in themselves 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 12 . . 19:20:50 . 26/ So bookstores need to have the books people want, but they also need something else. A coffee shop, or bar maybe. Event space and a constant slate of events. A political angle, perhaps (tho these seem to chronically underestimate the value of selling the books people want) 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 14 . . 19:25:35 . 27/ My place sells local authors. We&#39;re also a family store with a cute backstory. We held a ton of events (before covid) for local authors and poets, building goodwill in that community. I&#39;m not sure that the local books will ever turn a profit. But those authors buy books 🤑 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 14 . . 19:28:16 . 28/ This is a great point. Bookstores are a public space where you can meet other book people. We considered Book People as a name for the store in fact, becuase it&#39;s that important to the vibe. but it&#39;s already a well-established store in Austin. https://t.co/k6p7hJEgqB 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 17 . . 19:30:23 . 29/ Bookstores are romantic. I see a lot of dates. (They don&#39;t buy much) I actually met my gf in the bookstore. She walked in and I neurotically reshelved books until she talked to me. Then she stumbled on her words and we introduced ourselves and shook hands. thne she left 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 22 . . 19:42:32 . 33/ My gf is one of those people who actively destroys a book by reading it. She folds the front cover around to the back. She sets it face down wide open. She&#39;ll use any object as a bookmark: pencil, hair tie, spoon, a whole nother book. She&#39;s wonderful, but we are different 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 14 . . 19:43:55 . 34/ I don&#39;t mind this anymore, actually. Growing up I treated books as sacred (except the ones i left in my car with the windows down in the rain) But now I look at a book-destroyer and think: good. Keep supply down 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 19:45:53 . 35/ I do like to keep my books in good condition, though. Especially now that I can actually sell them. Pretty much any book I read I take back to the store, except the ones that are super special to me. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 9 . . 19:47:32 . 36/ So my house has a mixture of super-treasured rare valuable books, random paperbacks that gf devoured, and dozens of strays that I rescued from the trash. Things like &quot;100 Important Knots&quot; or &quot;A Friendly Introduction to Math&quot; that were too beat up to sell but too cute to die 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 16 . . 19:52:30 . 37/ I am actually a bad person to answer this question, I think. I had never been a bookstore clerk before opening a bookstore. I suppose general clerking experience will help. And then you&#39;ll want some book knowledge ;) Maybe a specialty, a genre https://t.co/upi61C2Rrt 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 10 . . 19:53:51 . 38/ Really, the best way is to go the bookstore a lot and be friendly with whoever works there. I doubt a bookstore has to put up an ad on craigslist; the people who hang around are already trusted and familiar with the space and its rules. Bookstores are made of people 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 11 . . 19:58:49 . 39/ This is genius. Your load gets lighter the more you read. One time me and gf were gonna hike a mountain and sleep at the top. We were near the end of this hardback (we read out loud) didn&#39;t want to bring the weight. So she cut out the last 20 pages https://t.co/cDnnPyl5QO 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 13 . . 20:01:38 . who else had a flyer as a kid like Tech Wizard 🧙‍♂️ Fix your Computer $20 ea ??? 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 14 . . 20:06:33 . 40/ Maybe the best way to become a bookstore clerk is to start a bookstore. You just got have a business bank account and you can start ordering books wholesale. I know someone who has a couple shelves in one of these &quot;retail collective&quot; spaces. Pretty cheap rent I think 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 12 . . 21:32:21 . Meaning and purpose await you in the off-world colonies 🗨️ 5 ♺ 20 🤍 135 . . 21:53:16 . I post them like I see them 🗨️ 0 ♺ 1 🤍 8 . . 21:54:53 .

This won&#39;t work for a local app 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 9 . . 11:17:45 . okay, maybe I can host the model and indexing stuff on a VPS somewhere and make a frontend app to talk to the API. that would allow me to use any computer or phone to save and search the same meme database. tried prototyping this locally -- CORS problems! 🤬 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 10 . . 11:19:06 . i think i can run an API on one localhost port and the frontend at a different localhost port and have them talk to each other.

In my original buildout I use torch dataloaders to do batching functionality but it&#39;s still the heaviest step in the pipeline for sure. indexing and storing embeddings helps, of course 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 11:28:08 . but it really seems like a piece of metadata that should be available to the operating system, file picker, etc. once it&#39;s been computed at all. what if memery were integrated into GNOME Overview or Spotlight 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 11:30:45 . on the other hand, i was clearly thinking differently about it a month ago https://t.co/EUtpV7Npgt 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 7 . . 11:37:54 . he made it sound so easy https://t.co/2bG6VBO7G0 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 10 . . 12:06:39 .

I already feel like I&#39;m too mean and aloof on here a lot of the time. so much worse to do it unconstructively. ✌️ Love you all, later 🗨️ 4 ♺ 0 🤍 34 . . 15:17:26 . what i&#39;m talking about is a social problem, not a technological one. this is not something you need blockchains for. or VR, or AI. what you need is a *strange attractor*. a flag, a mutual vision that draws together a disparate group of people. a swarm of squads 🗨️ 6 ♺ 4 🤍 76 . . 15:27:38 . and these are congregations! that strange attractor is an egregore. a little baby godling. egregores want to help people get together and align their actions toward a greater goal. that&#39;s why we&#39;re symbiotic. but in return, we must build them somewhere to live 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 38 . . 15:32:25 . and we must tell them our purpose. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 29 . . 15:35:44 . this doesn&#39;t have to be a startup, or a co-op, or a communist revolution. there are internet subcultures who are able to divert a bunch of money and power into building their realities simply as users. i.e.: furries, gamers, memers, tiktok dancers https://t.co/CxdFNPhpqA 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 45 . . 15:41:50 . i&#39;m glad that people are building the financial and digital infrastructure for new egregores, outside of the current system of nations and corporations. but ultimately what it will need is a level of ritual, personal devotion, and trust equal to a cult, or religion 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 31 . . 15:43:17 . and unfortunately for me, i will find it hard to engage with cultish behavior. i&#39;ve been hurt badly by it before, with people i knew and loved in person. how do you find people to trust on the internet? 🗨️ 4 ♺ 1 🤍 37 . . 15:48:16 . in a way this is the genius of the Constitution DAO. crowd-owning a sacred text will give purpose to all the people who participate, and a sense of unearned trust. the opposite of a secret society lol. you know these people share your values. literally! https://t.co/QvSeqb4oDB 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 36 . . 15:53:32 . i don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll be able to do it, especially if their buying power is visible on the blockchain. if they don&#39;t have 20 mil, they can&#39;t bluff their way to the top. and if they do, they can still be outbid. maybe they&#39;re planning some cool smart contract shit, idk 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 15 . . 15:56:03 . i wouldn&#39;t join them anyway. i need a DAO that&#39;s producing things. in the real world, ideally, but software will be necessary as well. it doesn&#39;t have to collect things, it doesn&#39;t have to 1000x in value. most people are sketched out by things that 1000x in value! they&#39;re risky! 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 21 . . 15:59:38 . what i really want: • steady, meaningful work to do for • people I care about. i have this now -- family business -- and it&#39;s great! but it isn&#39;t something that will scale. and i also want • to build collective power around a communal vision to change the world 🗨️ 2 ♺ 2 🤍 56 . . 16:02:41 . i know what that vision is, for me. and i know a lot of people who agree with it! but i don&#39;t know how to build a congregation around it. i don&#39;t have the tools, and i don&#39;t have the social finesse 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 29 . . 16:04:39 . maybe i can focus on articulating a vision. other people can disagree with it, or build on top of it. either way it would be useful to have common frame of reference for discussion. a lot of this stuff is nifty technologically, but not grounded in real people&#39;s needs 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 27 . . 16:13:30 . how can i write a promising vision for the future without becoming a focal point for an egregore? i need to build it a virtual house, with a virtual name. like when Plato made up Socrates otherwise this shit will get serious far too fast. as we have seen https://t.co/9y9SVA6EyQ 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 39 . . 16:31:37 . i guess the crux here is &quot;actually important to do&quot;. assuming we have some amount of funds and labor, what is the most valuable thing to do with it? it has to be something that pays back, at least enough to not deplete our funds and labor. but it also has to have a purpose 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 28 . . 16:33:43 . i&#39;ve known people in the intentional communities scene for a decade. coming up with a communal purpose is hard. finding one that&#39;s also a successful business model? nearly impossible. i guess the peanut butter factory does okay. but they&#39;re not scaling 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 25 . . 16:40:54 . again, here, the middle stairs are missing. there are long term visions for humanity (already outlining the religious wars to come), and there are short-term strategies like &quot;do a startup&quot; &quot;start a podcast&quot; &quot;pump a dog coin&quot; &quot;get foodies&quot; we need cathedrals to build 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 24 . . 16:46:07 . not cathedrals of historic proportion. we should not build for the fortunes of families, or the armies of states, or the glory of old gods. we should build cathedrals to Nature, without whom we would never have made it this far. and to Science, without which we won&#39;t make it out 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 24 . . 16:53:37 . great question. so what i actually mean is that we live on a planet that is past several boundaries for stable ecological functioning and we need to move rapidly en masse to fix it https://t.co/9UTNLAmSpM 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 19 . . 16:56:48 . we probably need to return about 50% of the surface to biodiverse full-succession ecosystems (not sure how much of ocean). without killing a bunch of people, so we need to maintain/adapt technoindustrial cities to hold billions more people is that vague https://t.co/ce4WH2e5ei 🗨️ 4 ♺ 1 🤍 30 . . 16:59:13 . what we need are cathedrals to nature (rehabitats) and to science (arcologies). to steward the climate for the indefinite future. because A) nobody else is going to do it, and B) complex life unlikely to develop again if we kill it all! it&#39;s a huge mission. where is quest giver? 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 29 . . 17:00:11 . currently there are billions of people who would like to save the planet, very few people who will actively say that they want to kill the planet. a good number of people who say one but do the other. unfortunately, the power is locked up by that last group 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 19 . . 17:02:08 . power here meaning &quot;ability to coordinate mass human behavior&quot;. states have it, religions have it, monied persons and corporations have it. they can&#39;t get everybody to save the planet all at once either! they&#39;re caught in status games and multipolar traps. 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 17 . . 17:05:21 . if that power could somehow be liquidated -- if we could coordinate our behavior well enough that i could predictably have a roof over my head by working to save the planet -- lots of people would want to do it! we&#39;re trapped in a local minimum https://t.co/03DBM56T8p 🗨️ 1 ♺ 2 🤍 31 . . 17:08:00 . other people will use these same tools for different values. that&#39;s the nature of tools. i will try to articulate more vision and draw more people i guess 🗨️ 0 ♺ 1 🤍 21 . . 17:11:46 . opinion level objects thread 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 4 . . 17:30:29 . interesting result! three-quarters of my followers are male https://t.co/JNpD7u4oky 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 20:23:21 . this &quot;squid game&quot; isn&#39;t very fun at all! 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 31 . . 21:05:45 . the contacts in your phone should decay.

            "content": "What is this page? . A potential employer asked me to demonstrate a few pieces of my code. . I decided to do it here in my notebook, where am I comfortable and where other people who wish to might see it. . This notebook is generated with the fastpages framework. Fastpages allows me to write my posts in Jupyter notebooks. That means I can include my code and the actual results it outputs, right on the page. Under the hood, fastpages converts .ipynb notebook files into markdown files, and passes those to the Jekyll static site generator. Jekyll is written in Ruby, which I don’t know very well, but it was one of the first popular static site generators and it has strong integration with Github, so I’ve gotten pretty familiar with it over the years. I wrote a few custom modules on top of fastpages, in Liquid and HTML, but mostly left the site uncustomized. On the previous version of my website I spent a lot of time customizing JSX and not enough time posting. I now correct that trend. . The potential employer asked me for 4 things: 1) front-end (a short example in React works) 2) back-end code (anything in Python) 3) ML modeling - non-DL, and 4) a DL model. . As a self-taught coder, looking back at old code can be an embarrassing experience from me. I haven’t had a lot of feedback on my code, so I only realize how bad it was when I look at it with more experienced eyes. Nonetheless, it will be a good learning experience for me, so here goes. ## Front-end code . Front-end code . An old friend asked me to design, develop and host a small website for their community herbalism group in Portland. They mostly organize through Instagram and Facebook, but wanted a flyer site at https://plantainproject.org to point people to. Especially donors. . I used the Gatsby framework, which was probably overkill for this use case but was a satisfying level of complexity to be a learning project for me. Mostly what I did was modify a template someone else had made, but I’m still pretty proud of the design decisions I made. . They gave me only a logo (hand-drawn), a few photos, and a text manifesto. I converted the logo to SVG and colorized it, built a color palette and chose fonts around the logo design. Then I designed a layout with CSS Grid, which allowed me to control the pacing of the website using viewport height. . . I did this project before I really understood how to use Git, so the bulk of the project was done in one commit (“lump-based development”?). I know better now, but this does give the advantage of seeing all the changes in one diff. I actually wrote this code in fall 2018, but didn’t commit it to a git repo until 2020. :sweat_smile: . Here’s a small grid-based component, using CSS-in-JSX and styled-components, which was the fashion at the time. I haven’t worked in React much over the last couple years, so who knows how much has changed. . . Note: this is not the most recent project I have done in Gatsby and React, but the others were more complicated and suffered more from JS churn. . Back-end code . Because this website is built with fastpages, I am able to write literate programs in Jupyter notebooks and use them to modify the website itself. . I decided to extract the posts I make on Twitter and post them on this site, where they serve as a live-log of my daily thoughts. In Archive my tweets I walk through the process of scraping tweets with twint, downloading attached images and converting them to Markdown posts. These become “deepfates log” posts like this day where I only tweeted once . Machine learning code . Please see my page Sales Data Exploration where I clean and analyze book rankings from Amazon. I go further still in Minimum Distortion Embedding on book data, reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and finding clusters, but I do use some deep learning embeddings as features in that notebook. . . Deep learning code . I refer the reader to my project Legiblate, where I train an image classifier to judge the genre of a book by its cover. Or try the Legiblate app yourself! . .",

            "content": "I have collected different types of data on books, most recently Amazon sales rank, and explored direct plots of those variables in Sales data exploration. Now I want to use minimum distortion embedding, or MDE, to project those multi-dimensional variables into a 2D embedding space, and plot that. . MDE . Doing the embedding requires a subset of data that is purely numerical, so let&#39;s grab thos ecolumns and covnert to an ndarray. We&#39;ll use the same slice of the dataset from the previous slice, for consistency. We can scale it up to the full dataset later. . MDE also wants no NaN values, so we can use .dropna() to drop those. Only a fraction of the dataset has those missing values, so hopefully won&#39;t affect it too much. . import pandas as pd import altair as alt sorted_corner_df = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/sorted_corner_df.csv&#39;) numbers_df = sorted_corner_df[[&#39;publication_year&#39;, &#39;num_pages&#39;, &#39;average_rating&#39;, &#39;text_reviews_count&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;]].dropna() len(numbers_df) . 4283 . numbers_array = numbers_df.to_numpy() . import pymde %matplotlib inline . mde = pymde.preserve_neighbors(numbers_array, verbose=True) embedding = mde.embed(verbose=True) .

These data points should be the same as the blue-purple graph from my last post (average_rating vs rank), but arranged by the constraints of each numerical feature. Let&#39;s compare the two. . The following chart uses a common brush selection for two graphs with different encoded axes. That means if you select points on one side, you should be able to see the same points light up on the other. . numbers_df[[&#39;mde_x&#39;, &#39;mde_y&#39;]] = embedding.tolist() embed_df = numbers_df.merge(sorted_corner_df) . brush = alt.selection_interval() chart1 = alt.Chart(embed_df).mark_point(filled=True).encode( size = alt.Size(&#39;ratings_count&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;, range=[.075,75]), ), color=alt.condition( brush, alt.Color(&#39;text_reviews_count&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;, scheme=&#39;bluepurple&#39;) ), alt.value(&#39;lightgray&#39;)), opacity = alt.OpacityValue(0.6), tooltip = [&#39;title_gr&#39;, &#39;author_name&#39;, &#39;publication_year&#39;, &#39;category&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;, &#39;text_reviews_count&#39;, &#39;average_rating&#39;, &#39;ratings_count&#39;] ).properties( width = 420, height = 340 ).add_selection( brush ) chart1.encode(x = &#39;mde_x&#39;, y = &#39;mde_y&#39;) &amp; chart1.encode(x = alt.X(&#39;rank&#39;, scale=alt.Scale( domain=[-10, 23000], reverse=True), ), y = alt.Y(&#39;average_rating&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;linear&#39;, domain=[3.5,4.7]))) . Here we can see several things about the data: . Rank is a strong indicator. This makes sense, because this is the top-ranked section of the data, so the power-law curve is smooth and steep. . | Review/ratings count sems to be correlated with the little tendrils that are reaching toward the center. This makes sense, as there is also a power-law dynamic here. . | . This is good information, but it seems to be fitting heavily on the ratings count and rank. As far as this algorithm is concerned, these numbers could be anything: they&#39;re sales data for objects with certain measurements attached. . What if we could turn the text fields into numeric fields too? Then we could get some of that information about author, genre, title, and description that really define whether people like a book. Well, with sentence_transformers we can! . from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer nlp = SentenceTransformer(&#39;all-MiniLM-L6-v2&#39;) . The idea behind sentence transformers is this: take a pretrained neural network model and cut off the head layer, the bit that does the actual &#39;prediction&#39;. Now you have a latent space projector: the neural net transfers the input data into its hidden space of world-knowledge, and outputs a set of numbers that approximate that input: an embedding. . The fun thing about embeddings is that you can do math on them. Word vector arithmetic is well studied, and similar transformations work with sentence embeddings. We can also use more complicated mathematical functions on them. Like MDE, hopefully! . I&#39;ll create a dataframe with just the non-numerical attributes. . text_df = sorted_corner_df.drop([ &#39;Unnamed: 0&#39;, &#39;isbn&#39;, &#39;asin&#39;, &#39;title_gr&#39;, &#39;publication_year&#39;, &#39;num_pages&#39;, &#39;average_rating&#39;, &#39;ratings_count&#39;, &#39;text_reviews_count&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;], axis=1) filled_text_df = text_df.fillna(&quot;Unknown&quot;) . filled_text_df.head() . author_name top_genre publisher format description title_az category . 0 William Baird | bible | Unknown | Hardcover | Unknown | History of New Testament Research, Vol. 1 | BibleStudy&amp;Reference | . 1 Larry Hama | comics | Marvel Comics | Paperback | Unknown | G.I.

It has certainly picked up some information from the text embeddings, as we can see from the clustering of formats here. But notably, there&#39;s no long snake of a linear variable like rank. Let&#39;s wrangle this into an interactive graph and see what information we can get from it, before combining all the datapoints in a massive final MDE crossover event. . filled_text_df[[&#39;mde_x&#39;, &#39;mde_y&#39;]] = embedding.tolist() . embed_df = filled_text_df.merge(sorted_corner_df) embed_df.columns .

This plot has a good representation of the contents of these books! . See, for example, the subcontinent at the bottom of the graph, where board books, picture books, middle-reader books and young adult novels climb the southeastern coast. See also the peninsula of graphic novels in the far West, reaching out toward the island of manga. . In the north there is the insular nation of cookbooks, bordered by health and home improvement. South of there are the cantons of psychology and self-help and business, who hate to be lumped in with their neighbors in Christian living. The southern coast belongs to biography, history and memoir, while the heartland sprawls from craft through art and photography to the faraway lands of fiction and fantasy. . I&#39;m honestly impressed by how well this works. The mapping of categories is surprisingly tight, outside of data leakage like the &quot;favorites&quot; class in top_genre. Then with the size, shape and opacity settings you can really see the different types of book and their differing sales. There&#39;s insights aplenty to be found in here, but i&#39;m itching to see what the graph looks like if we include all the features as constraints in one MDE equation. Let&#39;s find out. .

Hmm.. . n_df = numbers_df.drop([&#39;mde_x&#39;, &#39;mde_y&#39;], axis=1) normalized_numbers_df=(n_df - n_df.min()) / (n_df.max()-n_df.min()) . t_df = pd.DataFrame(dropped_text_embeds_array) normalized_text_embeds_df=(t_df - t_df.min()) / (t_df.max() - t_df.min()) . full_normed_array = np.hstack((normalized_text_embeds_df.to_numpy(), normalized_numbers_df.to_numpy())) full_normed_array[1] . array([6.33223355e-01, 6.22407913e-01, 3.81173670e-01, ..., 3.10000000e-01, 6.12342095e-04, 0.00000000e+00]) . normed_mde = pymde.preserve_neighbors(full_normed_array) normed_embedding = normed_mde.embed() pymde.plot(normed_embedding, color_by=normalized_numbers_df[&#39;rank&#39;]) . &lt;AxesSubplot:&gt; .

Inferences . Still pretty similar. Some things have changed -- science humor and poetry are off the tip of biography now, and the craft-gaming border has become a peninsular of its own, tipped with music. Certainly lots to dig into here. Next time I will run this transformation across the whole dataset, and render it into some huge explorable 2d or even 3d graph. I think it would also make sense to cat all the text features into one sentence before calculating the embeddings, both to save time and so hopefully the numerical features get a better showing. . I will say this for now -- in the new, fully normalized graph (the left-hand one above), it wouldn&#39;t be totally unfair to say that top to bottom is the &quot;age&quot; axis, and right to left is the &quot;fun&quot; axis. Unfortunately, most people travel southwest on this terrain throughout their lifetime... . full_embed_df.to_csv(&#39;../../records/mde-embedded-slice.csv&#39;) .",

Typists HATE him! 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 10 . . 10:20:52 . anyone know where to get a copy of the Continental Prophecies of William Blake? literally asking for a friend https://t.co/KLQHQ5XAW2 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 3 . . 10:49:45 . i think there is a type of article in which the author learned to write from college, where saying &quot;capitalism is bad&quot; is an intellectual applause light that saves you from having to make any other argument 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 34 . . 10:55:38 . you can see it here, where a Chobani yogurt ad is used as an example of capitalism making money off solarpunk aesthetics. and yet, the artist and others are quoted as saying they think this art is converting minds and providing an alternate vision, no matter who pays for it https://t.co/aVTLJb68Yt . 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 15 . . 10:59:26 . contrast to this comment https://t.co/8kiSUvAEVN . 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 24 . . 11:11:31 . but you can&#39;t get your piece picked up by Vice (an impressively capitalist organization) if it doesn&#39;t contain this &quot;capitalism is bad&quot; message. And tbf the writer probably didn&#39;t pick the &quot;End of Capitalism&quot; headline. But this attitude has been a throughline of solarpunk. why? 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 15 . . 11:18:15 . Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have been equally guilty. Just a couple years ago I wrote an essay that declares that solarpunk utopians have to lead the way against capitalist growth. It ended with the words &quot;How do we do that?&quot; https://t.co/t1q6S5mCXt https://t.co/ZzJYLGXUIA . 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 13 . . 11:29:52 . This line of questioning is the point at which many Solarpunks start doing 🤷🤷🤷 and saying phrases like &quot;decentralization&quot;, &quot;stewardship&quot;, &quot;regenerative agriculture&quot;, &quot;creating a movement&quot;. These are all surely headings to follow, but they don&#39;t provide a theory of change. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 15 . . 11:33:40 . Even &quot;get solarpunk imagery into corporate advertisements as a way of popularizing a better world&quot; is a theory of change. And there have been some more practical pieces, like ADH&#39;s seminal 2015 essay https://t.co/C4b0qRg4Eb. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 16 . . 11:36:26 . Still a great essay. He discusses the gritty climate-collapse scenarios that put the &quot;punk&quot; in solar punk, and has a real grasp of the demographic basis of the near future. But he takes it as an axiom that technical problems are downstream from political problems. I disagree 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 15 . . 11:46:07 . I have done political organizing. I have built community center in a big city, occupied parks, marched and blockaded and communed. I helped start an XR chapter and I have interfaced with the Sunrise movement. I don&#39;t think it works. Not fast enough, anyway. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 15 . . 11:50:40 . The feedback loops on climate collapse are fast and unpredictable. We&#39;re going to need massive technological development to rehabilitate the planet, as well as the buy-in of most of the people. This is good! Most people want the climate to not collapse 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 17 . . 11:56:11 . Unfortunately, most people are not in control of the decision-making apparatus. There is a ruling class. Critics of capitalism are correct in this. They are incorrect in thinking that democratic oversight is the answer. Democratic nation-states are currently in a bad way 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 12 . . 12:00:21 . Democracies can&#39;t outmaneuver corporations. Democracies are made of people, and people are fallible. They have all kinds of complicated desires. And capitalism is nothing if not good at exploiting desire 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 16 . . 12:02:31 . Democracy is slow. Modern data-backed corporations are getting constant feedback, from their users and from the markets. They&#39;re hyperfocused on their one goal, usually profit, and they have tons of flexibility to decide how to do that. They can be slightly evil, as a treat 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 16 . . 12:04:05 . Again, I am not saying this is a good value system! Just that it&#39;s a strong design and keeps winning over &quot;political&quot; style organization. *slaps roof of Decoupled society of market transactions* this baby can hold so may contradictions. and still runs like a beaut 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 18 . . 12:11:06 . Democracy and capitalism will both fail to bend to external conditions fast enough. The future people will create too much novelty for these centralized models to contain. Half of the people on Earth were born since 1970 https://t.co/W6spXO7oyu 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 10 . . 12:16:07 . So in my view the best leverage point is not politics, but technology. things like DAOs, microfab, AI models, and of course solar power will enable the actual movement of the means of production to communities in a decentralized way. and give them access to markets, bazaars 🗨️ 1 ♺ 3 🤍 27 . . 12:18:03 . I don&#39;t think that forcing people to change or falsify their preferences is a route with very much traction. Giving them new options, new powers, does. But it still won&#39;t be the end of capitalism. Because these guilds, coops, patches will still find conflict 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 12:20:07 . The high-coupling way says you can simply War your enemies into going along with your way. and that certainly does solve conflict, in a sense. but it&#39;s expensive, and takes a long time. The decoupling side says, Trade and Ignore. Transactional society scales across cultures 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 14 . . 12:21:27 . Time is a thing we don&#39;t have much of. Desire for a better future is something that we have a lot of, but can&#39;t act upon. And democracy and capitalism are both warped by the lack of feedback available to those at the top. They literally can&#39;t feel our pain, hear our desires 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 12:23:06 . The process of commodification of technology will continue until the living standards improve, is what I&#39;m saying. And many people don&#39;t know how to envision a world where they have choice in that process. So they write it off as &quot;capitalism&quot; and wait for its inevitable End 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 16 . . 12:25:31 . This quote always gets thrown around. In this article Adam Flynn is quoting it from Jameson or Zizek. attributions vary I think it is backwards https://t.co/LWjEIHz5GD . 🗨️ 6 ♺ 2 🤍 15 . . 12:31:55 . It is easier to imagine the end of capitalism than it is to imagine the end of the world. Because if you truly imagine the end of the world, the corpses, refugees, dust bowls, hard work, unanswered prayers... You might accept that capitalism could be part of the solution 🗨️ 1 ♺ 2 🤍 20 . . 12:40:19 . What i&#39;m saying is: the Chobani ad IS SOLARPUNK. The future will be robot DAO permaculture farms selling organic GMO produce to big cities full of old people maintaining the sky.

            "content": "Around the end of 2020 I learned to train Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, on image datasets to create art generators. I used a bunch of book and font data and made a series i call Language Arts. . To display those in the fastpages framework I need to make markdown files for each of the projects, with its own date and description, and a list of image tags to display. Also a header image and video tags for any interpolation videos. And of course I&#39;ll need to copy some images over from the folder itself. . Creating a template string has worked so far, for generating markdown folders. I can&#39;t do it entirely programmatically because I want to insert relevant comments for each one as I recall them. And I want to hand select the images, so I don&#39;t just copy over a bunch of crappy early-epoch training images. Probably the best way to do this is to hcopy images for each GAN project to subfolder of images with its name, then use a function of the folder name and manually-added metadata to build a markdown file over the contents of the folder. There are only so many projects I&#39;ve built, and the marginal cost for adding a new one will be small if I can re-use the function. . from IPython.display import Markdown from pathlib import Path in_dir = &#39;../images/book_cover_gan&#39; images = [file for file in Path(in_dir).iterdir()] . The following will display all the images when printed into the notebook, but doesn&#39;t get picked up by the fastpages converter, so it looks bad on the website. Maybe some day I will fix the converter myself, but until then I&#39;m okay with generating markdown files that will work . images[:5] .

Wrap it all in a function with minimum necessary inputs, and we can print a few in quick succession!

I used the [unscii](http://viznut.fi/unscii/) font because it has glyphs for most of the Unicode characters. Unfortunately, since it&#39;s a bitmap font suitable for ASCII terminals, the end result is very pixelated is hard to imagine as letters. It also tended toward mode collapse, as the generator figured out it could fool the discriminator with a very faint grid of dots in a gridlike pattern.&quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;/images/unscii-gan.mp4&quot;) . write_md(&#39;../images/symbol_gan_noto&#39;, &#39;2021-02-05&#39;, &quot;&quot;&quot;A model finetuned from my unscii GAN. I tried with Noto font from Google, but the underlying model was too deranged. Also, Noto has a lot more Eastern ideograms than Western characters and I don&#39;t know how to tell if those are even translating properly.&quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;/images/noto-gan.mp4&quot;) . write_md(&#39;../images/symbol_gan_code2000&#39;, &#39;2021-02-09&#39;, &quot;&quot;&quot;I recreated my Unicode glyphs dataset with the abandonware font [Code2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20110108105420/http://code2000.net/), which has great coverage for Western characters as well as a funky, humanist design. This time I started to see real characters emerge among the imagined ones. It was at this point that I began to wonder if this was a good thing to do to my brain. But it was too late...&quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) . write_md(&#39;../images/symbol_gan_4word&#39;, &#39;2021-03-08&#39;, &quot;&quot;&quot;After many false starts and dead ends, I finally found a concept that would truly drive me insane. I finetuned my Code2000 symbol GAN model on a set of generated images. These images consisted of the 1,000 most commonly used four-letter words in English. With the newly trained model, I generated some new ones. If you would like to purchase one of these word worms, you can find them in NFT form at the [Language Arts Marketplace](https://opensea.io/collection/language-arts). I can&#39;t imagine why you would, but there it is. **Warning: I don&#39;t know what happens if you stare at these for too long! Use at your own risk.**&quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) .",

A funny thing about Colab notebooks is that they&#39;re ostensibly designed for literate programming, but in reality tend towards either messy blobs of code or simplified GUIs built out of forms. it&#39;s like the early days of film. nobody knows how to use this medium fully 🗨️ 5 ♺ 5 🤍 57 . . 18:18:30 . everybody gangster when they&#39;re behind the wheel 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 18:22:47 . gf Who leaves unlabeled jars of mystery liquids in the fridge 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 16 . . 18:23:56 . *taking a long drag of a suspicious looking cigarette* 😮‍💨 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 18:26:45 .

Not as easy to import packages and environments. Even harder to generate production code. So it&#39;s like the Danger Room for most people. a playground, not the real thing https://t.co/BfFNiYIXg1 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 13 . . 18:34:33 . message to all my dudes, guys, fellas: You can use emojis too 🤙 🗨️ 27 ♺ 1 🤍 69 . . 18:36:24 . problem 2: situating yourself inside the notebook. it&#39;s hard to keep track of state, and as soon as you start running cells out of order it&#39;s easy to get in trouble. some kind of introspection tools would be great here. (also predictable time limits 🥺) https://t.co/XZAPEzQBMU 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 8 . . 18:38:27 . Colab is like a pantomime of literary programming. It has the part where you mix text and code, but we sort of already had that. it&#39;s comments. what it doesn&#39;t have is the tangle / weave protocols 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 12 . . 18:40:45 . in Knuth&#39;s original vision for LP, Your source is text and code mixed together. And from that you &quot;tangle&quot; code files and &quot;weave&quot; documentation. The reason you can run cells out of order is supposed to be so that you can tell a Story about your code. Programs are literature 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 11 . . 18:45:49 . I am pretty impressed with nbdev. I used it to build a library and even with my amateur knowledge It was pretty straightforward. it&#39;s still pretty rough but I can sense that it is gaining momentum. It allows you to tangle and weave from a folder of NBs https://t.co/KgpnpSmPzc 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 18:48:22 . but Colab doesn&#39;t merge well with this process. G expects you to stay caged in their pseudo-file system and access your VM through a limited set of magic commands. I have heard no rumors of Google implementing tangle/weave, although I&#39;m open to hearing some 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 7 . . 18:51:49 . because of Google&#39;s file sharing/copying protocols, it&#39;s easier to share the notebook itself than a finished library or script. And because of Google&#39;s built-in version control, there&#39;s not a culture of forking and merging. Just infinite forks, or invisible in-place edits 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 18:57:33 . So right now there&#39;s like a zine culture around these notebooks. there&#39;s a low threshold for entry. like zines, there&#39;s also a hard limit to how well they can communicate over multiple minds through time https://t.co/HfkrMlgjKm 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 4 . . 18:59:54 . but they&#39;re so vital! as in filled with life force. as in, they have the Juice.

If you can stumble through this confusing interface full of inexplicable code https://t.co/f9dyhawfAF 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 19:01:42 . but there&#39;s still a coordination problem. An all-fork society continually fragments and mutates, but best practices are not merged back into the trunk. there is no sacred timeline. This is what things like version control, package management, even file folders are *meant for* 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 6 . . 19:06:22 . we need an entire workflow, that starts with somebody sharing their code, through to your development of that code, and the option to merge it upstream. with explorability and introspection at all stages. until then we are in the silent film era 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 6 . . 19:20:35 . with that attitude 😇 https://t.co/S6S6xFIUQN 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 20:48:39 . this is It 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 11 . . 21:15:22 . if i would have just posted the meme it would have got hundred of likes 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 10 . . 21:24:04 . it&#39;s funny to me that people think I&#39;m a curmudgeon or an attention-seeking contrarian. in real life I&#39;m incredibly happy and filled with purpose. i just come here to share things that you&#39;re not supposed to say in polite society 🗨️ 5 ♺ 2 🤍 44 . . 21:38:31 . like i already have a place to be fake nice to people lol it&#39;s called work 🗨️ 1 ♺ 2 🤍 24 . .",

            "content": "I want to extract all the tweets I&#39;ve ever written and convert them to small markdown files so they show up as &quot;posts&quot; on this website. . Posts are organized by date, in the traditional blogging format. But so are tweets, kind of? They&#39;re listed chronologically anyway. Maybe I could make one post for each day, and then have all the tweets listed on that page. Each one could have its tweet ID as a header, thus having an internal link. Tweets can link to the tweets that precede them, and maybe even backlink to tweets that follow. . It&#39;s not quite block references, but as a way of keeping my second brain under my ownership it should work. And this way if anyone wants to cancel me they&#39;ll have a convenient search box and permalinks for it. Even if my account gets deleted, my bad takes can stay up. . from pathlib import Path out_dir = Path(&#39;../_posts/tweets/&#39;) posts = [o.name for o in out_dir.iterdir()] last_date = sorted(posts)[-2][:10] last_date . &#39;2021-10-19&#39; . This :point_up: is a workaround. Sometime after I started archiving my tweets, Twitter changed the API for search. This means that unofficial scrapers like twintstopped being able to see tweets from more than a few months ago. Even the in-app search was broken for a while. . Fortunately I had already scraped and archived my old tweets, so now I just check to see when the last time I ran this script was and find tweets since that date. This also helps protect me from getting rate-limited by Twitter (they tend to do that if you download 30,000 tweets a few times in a row lol). . import twint import nest_asyncio nest_asyncio.apply() c = twint.Config() c.Username = &#39;deepfates&#39; tweets = [] c.Store_object = True c.Store_object_tweets_list = tweets c.Since = last_date c.Hide_output = True twint.run.Profile(c) . &lt;twint.run.Twint at 0x7f8ba4086150&gt; . This is all the configuration necessary to grab my tweets. Have to use Hide_output = True, or it will print every single tweet in the output. . I now have a dataset of tweets. Let&#39;s explore one here, and see some of its metadata. . Check data . len(tweets) . 3250 . t = tweets[-1] . t.conversation_id, t.datestamp, t.datetime, t.id, t.likes_count, t.link, t.mentions, t.photos, t.quote_url, t.replies_count, t.reply_to, t.retweet, t.retweet_date, t.retweet_id, t.retweets_count, t.source, t.thumbnail, t.timestamp, t.timezone, t.tweet, t.urls, t.user_id, t.user_id_str, t.user_rt, t.user_rt_id, t.username, t.video .

            "content": "Still working on the Invisible Canon. Today I want to find a superset of canons for fiction: not genre fiction, but &quot;literature&quot;. Of course, the Stanford Literary Lab has already done work on this. In their Pamphlet 8: Between Canon and Corpus they demonstrate that overlaying different &quot;top 100 books of the 20th century&quot; lists leads to significant overlap, and can be used to triangulate a sort of &quot;most voted for&quot; list. They use six different lists and end up with roughly 400 unique books. . I can use this &quot;found canon&quot; technique to craft a data feature, something like &quot;number of times this work has been canonized&quot;. That&#39;s useful in its own right, but it could also be the target for a collaborative filtering system. . I need to extract that information from a bunch of HTML tables and PDF reports, because academics. And then map it to the features from my previous distillation. One problem that will arise is that goodreads data is sorted by edition, while the canon lists are sorted by work. So the first problem is to reshape the data. Pandas provides MultiIndex, a way of stacking data in multiple dimensions. let&#39;s try that . import pandas as pd pd.set_option(&quot;display.max_columns&quot;, None) . total_df = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/cleaned_goodreads_books.csv&#39;) . total_df = total_df.drop([&#39;Unnamed: 0&#39;, &#39;Unnamed: 0.1&#39;, &#39;Unnamed: 0.1.1&#39;], axis=1) . total_df.tail() . isbn text_reviews_count series language_code popular_shelves asin average_rating similar_books description format link authors publisher num_pages isbn13 publication_month publication_year url image_url book_id ratings_count work_id title top_genre author_name . 1215978 0689852959 | 1.0 | [] | NaN | [{&#39;count&#39;: &#39;22&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;to-read&#39;}, {&#39;count&#39;:... | NaN | 4.36 | [] | One of the most popular series ever published ... | Paperback | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331839.Jac... | [{&#39;author_id&#39;: &#39;10681&#39;, &#39;role&#39;: &#39;&#39;}, {&#39;author_... | Aladdin | 176.0 | 9780689852954 | 9.0 | 2002.0 | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331839.Jac... | https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/11... | 331839 | 18.0 | 25313618.0 | Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: Friend of the Arts | biography | Beatrice Gormley | . 1215979 0373126476 | 9.0 | [] | NaN | [{&#39;count&#39;: &#39;78&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;to-read&#39;}, {&#39;count&#39;:... | NaN | 3.42 | [&#39;2200344&#39;, &#39;695337&#39;, &#39;10333421&#39;, &#39;1934240&#39;, &#39;... | Blackmailed into marriage to save her family, ... | Paperback | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2685097-th... | [{&#39;author_id&#39;: &#39;319441&#39;, &#39;role&#39;: &#39;&#39;}] | Harlequin | 192.0 | 9780373126477 | 7.0 | 2007.0 | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2685097-th... | https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/11... | 2685097 | 112.0 | 2710420.0 | The Spaniard&#39;s Blackmailed Bride | harlequin | Trish Morey | . 1215980 178092870X | 2.0 | [] | eng | [{&#39;count&#39;: &#39;702&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;to-read&#39;}, {&#39;count&#39;... | NaN | 3.50 | [&#39;12064253&#39;, &#39;25017213&#39;, &#39;571796&#39;, &#39;27306126&#39;,... | Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is brought back to life... | Paperback | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26168430-s... | [{&#39;author_id&#39;: &#39;2448&#39;, &#39;role&#39;: &#39;&#39;}, {&#39;author_i... | MX Publishing | 148.0 | 9781780928708 | 8.0 | 2015.0 | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26168430-s... | https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440592011m... | 26168430 | 6.0 | 46130263.0 | Sherlock Holmes and the July Crisis | mystery | Arthur Conan Doyle | . 1215981 0765197456 | 6.0 | [] | NaN | [{&#39;count&#39;: &#39;37&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;to-read&#39;}, {&#39;count&#39;:... | NaN | 4.00 | [] | Gathers poems by William Blake, Emily Bronte, ... | Hardcover | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2342551.Th... | [{&#39;author_id&#39;: &#39;82312&#39;, &#39;role&#39;: &#39;Editor&#39;}] | Smithmark Publishers | 96.0 | 9780765197450 | 8.0 | 1996.0 | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2342551.Th... | https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/11... | 2342551 | 36.0 | 2349247.0 | The Children&#39;s Classic Poetry Collection | poetry | Nicola Baxter | . 1215982 162378140X | 17.0 | [&#39;658195&#39;] | eng | [{&#39;count&#39;: &#39;56&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;to-read&#39;}, {&#39;count&#39;:... | NaN | 4.37 | [&#39;23562786&#39;, &#39;13548289&#39;, &#39;26094541&#39;, &#39;20570173... | Volume One contains: &quot;Claimed,&quot; &quot;Tainted,&quot; and... | Paperback | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22017381-1... | [{&#39;author_id&#39;: &#39;7789809&#39;, &#39;role&#39;: &#39;&#39;}] | Guerrilla Wordfare | 306.0 | 9781623781408 | 4.0 | 2014.0 | https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22017381-1... | https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398621236m... | 22017381 | 70.0 | 41332799.0 | 101 Nights: Volume One (101 Nights, #1-3) | erotica | S.E.

It worked! Now I have a list of 927,891 individual works. Time to import the different canons, and associate their data to the books! . Gather the canons . I can build here off the great work of others. As mentioned above, the Stanford Literary Lab published six canons(PDF) that they concatenated into their 20th Century Fiction corpus. . I&#39;ve also found the incredible The Greatest Books project by Shane Sherman, which does a similar thing but with 196 lists! Unfortunately he only distributes the rankings post-weighting, whereas I would like each list to be a separate column and compare how many times each book gets mentioned. I have sent him a request for the lists but i may have to scrape this website myself... . For now, I should gather the lists that didn&#39;t make it onto Mr. Sherman&#39;s list. Those would be the bestsellers and the reader rankings, for the most part. He explicitly prefers prestige over popularity. So there are three lists from the LitLab pamphlet that I suspect didn&#39;t make it into the Greatest Books list, and a few from other places around the web, especially Penguin&#39;s 100 must-read classic books, as chosen by our readers. I err on the side of popularity, myself, but the goodreads ratings should do plenty to balance that effect. . %ls ../../records . bkunde.csv goodreads_books_0016.csv cleaned_goodreads_books.csv goodreads_books_0017.csv goodbooks-genre-pop-time.html* goodreads_books_0018.csv goodreads_books_0000.csv goodreads_books_0019.csv goodreads_books_0001.csv goodreads_books_0020.csv goodreads_books_0002.csv goodreads_books_0021.csv goodreads_books_0003.csv goodreads_books_0022.csv goodreads_books_0004.csv goodreads_books_0023.csv goodreads_books_0005.csv goodreads-classics.csv goodreads_books_0006.csv library-journal.csv goodreads_books_0007.csv modern-library-readers-list.csv goodreads_books_0008.csv modern-library.tsv goodreads_books_0009.csv penguin-readers.csv goodreads_books_0010.csv postcolonial-studies.csv goodreads_books_0011.csv pub-weekly.csv goodreads_books_0012.csv to_graph.csv* goodreads_books_0013.csv ucsd-goodreads-genre-pop-time.html* goodreads_books_0014.csv wikipedia-bestselling-books.csv goodreads_books_0015.csv . bestsellers = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/wikipedia-bestselling-books.csv&#39;) library = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/library-journal.csv&#39;) penguin = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/penguin-readers.csv&#39;) ml_readers = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/modern-library-readers-list.csv&#39;) pw_readers = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/pub-weekly.csv&#39;) psa = pd.read_csv(&#39;../../records/postcolonial-studies.csv&#39;) . for i in [bestsellers, library, penguin, ml_readers, pw_readers, psa]: print(len(i)) . 167 150 100 100 83 100 . See how these lists are all different lengths? That&#39;s why we can&#39;t just average out the different rankings. We need each book to have a one-hot encoding of the list, either 0 if it&#39;s not on or 1 if it is. So we have to add columns to our dataframe, one for each list. That really means I need a bunch of small lists, not one megalist like The Greatest Books provides.

Hey, that worked! The website has good semantic HTML, so it will be easy to extrapolate the same process to the rest of the . I want to make a dataframe of these lists, organized by title. That way I can sort it into the larger Goodreads dataset, or extract information from that one to this one, either way. . I don&#39;t care about relative rankings within a given list, just the cumulative amount of rankings across lists. So I can use a one-hot encoding: 0 if a book is not on a list, 1 if it is. There&#39;s probably a nifty method for this, but I&#39;ve never done it before, so I&#39;m just going to implement it manually right now. . First I&#39;ll try it on the data I already have. Then I&#39;ll start scraping the website. . local_lists = [bestsellers, library, penguin, ml_readers, pw_readers, psa] for i in local_lists: print(i.keys()) .

Don&#39;t care about date or genre or any of that, I can reconstruct that later. Either &#39;Book&#39; or &#39;Title&#39; exist in each one, and &#39;Author&#39; or in one case &#39;Author(s)&#39;, and that&#39;s all I can get from the Greatest Books website, so that&#39;s what i will work with here. . I didn&#39;t pair names with these lists, so I&#39;ll just zip up a little list of titles real quick: . list_names = [&#39;Wikipedia Bestselling&#39;, &#39;Library Journal&#39;, &#39;Penguin Readers&#39;, &#39;Modern Library Readers&#39;, &#39;PW Bestsellers&#39;, &#39;Postcolonial Studies&#39;] . titles_df = pd.DataFrame() . for i in range(6): name = list_names[i] print(name) df = local_lists[i] if &#39;Book&#39; in df.keys(): bk = &#39;Book&#39; else: bk = &#39;Title&#39; au = &#39;Author(s)&#39; if &#39;Author(s)&#39; in df.keys() else &#39;Author&#39; if &#39;Author&#39; in df.keys() else &#39; Author&#39; df[&#39;Author&#39;] = df[au] new_df = df[[bk, &#39;Author&#39;]].set_index(bk) new_df[name] = 1 titles_df = titles_df.append(new_df) .

            "content": "Memery lets you use human language to search your image collections. . For years I was frustrated every time I tried to find an image on my hard drive: a meme to send to a friend, a photo of an important moment, a screenshot of a relevant quote. No matter how organized your folders, a hierarchical tree just can&#39;t capture all the dimensions of an image collection. And once you&#39;ve found the right folder, your filenames better be easy to remember, or you still have to scan visually through hundreds of images. . This is a pre-computer workflow, sifting through folders of images and recognizing the one you need by eye. Computers make it faster, but they don&#39;t reduce the cognitive friction much. . That&#39;s where memery comes in. . Under the hood, memery uses the CLIP transformer developed by OpenAIto make image search meaning-full. . You can search for concrete nouns, like &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;wizard&quot;, or abstract concepts like &quot;graph&quot; or &quot;love&quot;. You can also search for text found in the image, like the word &quot;signal&quot;. . Here&#39;s memery searching for &quot;cat&quot; in a dataset of wholesome memes: . . Memery is also a library that can be included in python applications. For example, here&#39;s the first two results for &quot;bird&quot; in this website&#39;s image folder: . from memery.core import queryFlow birds = queryFlow(&#39;../images/&#39;, &#39;bird&#39;) birds[:2] . 1020it [00:00, 74742.57it/s] 1020it [00:00, 28044.88it/s] 0%| | 0/1 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s] . starting timer Checking files Indexing Loaded 996 encodings Encoding 6 new images . 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00, 6.17it/s] . Building treemap Saving 1001 encodings Converting query Searching 1001 images Done in 5.060962200164795 seconds . [&#39;../images/E84wm5UWEAAr5ie.png&#39;, &#39;../images/images/E84wm5UWEAAr5ie.png&#39;] . . Memery has many other features, including a browser-based GUI and a command-line interface. It&#39;s an open source project, and you can help! Find memery at Github, test it out, file issues and pull requests. . Together we can solve the meme search problem. .",

A lot of so-called discourse on here is just people being like &quot;things I don&#39;t understand sure are stupid&quot;. and then all their jagoff followers jumping in to agree 🗨️ 7 ♺ 0 🤍 18 . . 07:13:36 . 2) no main TL. discord is all little rooms, there&#39;s no public commons.

At least on Reddit, where you expect to see this shit, they have sub threads that get hidden after a certain level of back and forth. Twitter makes top-level comments the default view, instead of sub-threads at all, which is perhaps a more democratic dynamic 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 19 . . 07:22:29 . but discord makes real-time, high-context, status-thick interactions the norm.

            "title": "Canon Curation",
            "content": "What requirements do I have for Invisible Canon? . All canons are biased, so let me lay out my biases now. . One requirement I&#39;ve already discussed: . 5,000 books maximum | . This is to fit on the shelves, but also to define a reasonable outer limit on the number of books that could be considered &quot;canonical&quot;. Though the number of books keeps growing, even accelerating, there&#39;s a limit to how much any person can be asked to read. . If you read one book a week, it would take 95 years to read the whole five thousand. A goal to aspire to. . Another requirement, hinted above, is: . these books have to fit into a certain number of shelves, divided into categories | . We have about half our shelves given to novels, and the other half to nonfiction of various genres. I would like to keep it that way, for secret reasons. . Our ontology is nonstandard, but matches closely enough to the model in the above image. The proportion of books in each category could be changed. In fact I would like to change it, to more accurately reflect our sales data. I&#39;ll return to that. . Beyond that, I have a general preference for . popular, i.e. marketable, books. | . This is not a library, after all. A library values rare and well-preserved books. A bookstore values books that sell quickly and often, and are easy to replace. . For the latter reason, another preference is for . books that are in print (and ideally stocked by my distributor) | . Finally, I would like to avoid certain types of books, which have proven to not be worth carrying for various reasons: they are inflammatory, controversial, or ephemeral, or they are printed in such numbers that they are massively discounted at big-box stores. The bookstore has limited space, time and money for books -- in fact we all do -- so we want to carry a mostly consistent selection, rather than ever-shuffling flavors of the month. Framed as a positive criterion, let&#39;s say: . the classics, old, modern and future. | . What books will become classics? . In fact, another dimension on which we can think of books is something like classicness. I read somewhere that 6,000 books were published in the year 1920. Among them was James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses, a modern classic and one of the most canonical listed in Pamphlet 17. How many other books do we remember from that year? A hundred or so are listed on Wikipedia. Of those I recognize maybe ten. . A one in a thousand chance of a book becoming a classic? Not bad odds, you might think. But in 2019, four million books were published. Will we remember even 4,000 of them in a hundred years? I doubt it. . If the odds of creating a classic haven&#39;t scaled with the acceleration of printing, perhaps they have scaled with the growth of the literate population. Let&#39;s do a little code (finally!) and see if that seems reasonable. . Data below comes from Our World in Data . pop_literate_pc = {&#39;1920&#39;: 31.62, &#39;2016&#39;:86.25} pop_illiterate_pc = {&#39;1920&#39;:68.38, &#39;2016&#39;:13.75} . total_pop = {&#39;1920&#39;:(7.38+95.63+114.87+47.21+164.86+1005)*1000000, &#39;2016&#39;:(40.44+630.15+359.52+744.27+1210+4480)*1000000} total_pop . {&#39;1920&#39;: 1434950000.0, &#39;2016&#39;: 7464380000.0} . total_literate_pop = {k: total_pop[k]*pop_literate_pc[k]*.01 for k in total_pop} total_literate_pop . {&#39;1920&#39;: 453731190.0, &#39;2016&#39;: 6438027750.0} . literate_pop_diff = total_literate_pop[&#39;2016&#39;] / total_literate_pop[&#39;1920&#39;] literate_pop_diff . 14.18907911091587 . There are 14 times as many literate adults today as there were in 1920. That includes both writers and readers, so perhaps it will scale to our imaginary classicness metric. . Given my ballpark estimate of 1 major work and 10 classics from 1920, that would suggest that 14 major works and 140 classics were published in 2016. Is that reasonable? Perhaps still a high estimate, but looking through Goodreads&#39; &#39;Most popular books published in 2016&#39; I recognize quite a few as big sellers (though ironically I&#39;ve only read one of the top 40, because I spend my time doing things like this instead of reading). . If this theory holds, that is the relation between number of literate people and the number of classics printed? . total_literate_pop[&#39;2016&#39;] / 140 . 45985912.5 . Maybe one in every 45 million people writes a classic book? Well, perhaps it&#39;s not fair to use the number of readers instead of the number of people trying to write. If we assume that a writer publishes one book in a year -- a reasonable assumption, given publishing house timelines -- how many books were published in 2016? We can divide that by our hypothetical 140 classics. . Wikipedia latest data ranges widely but should average out to roughly 2010s. They have a total of 2,200,000! . 2200000 / 140 . 15714.285714285714 . One in fifteen thousand books becomes a classic? And one in a hundred and fifty thousand books becomes a major work. . Sounds believable to me... . What is the point of this &quot;classicness&quot; discussion? . Classicness is a different variable than prestige or popularity. It&#39;s something like prominence: you can&#39;t tell which mountain is the biggest when you&#39;re in the mountains, but you can see it from a distance. At distance, though, details are lost. It&#39;s hard to see who was an almost-classic of a hundred years ago. And as time passes, even the classics are blurred, and only the really great works stand out. Books from hundreds or thousands of years ago, if they&#39;re still in print today, have a higher average quality than books of recent eras. They had to be good, to be copied or preserved through so much time. . Initial conditions, structural biases and random chance all play a part in what becomes classic, of course. Some books that should be classics simply never got the reach that they deserved. One could argue for a prescriptive canon, that proactively rights these wrongs, and restores the true greats to their rightful position; but there are many better qualified than I to make those claims. I will attempt to make a descriptive analysis of the data, with my biases stated plainly above, and leave it to them to challenge my findings. . Whatever intrinsic or extrinsic forces cause books to become classic, the fact is that some do. Some books reach through time and across half the world to touch people and inspire them. I want to know why, what factors affect it, and extrapolate that to all the books in the archive. A human eye may not be able to identify a future classic, but perhaps a computer can. . Ontology . The criteria, summed: . Five thousand books | Divided into categories | Marketable books | Still in print | With classic potential | I want a set of books that you could theoretically buy and fill your house with. Small enough to read over a lifetime, but big enough to ramble around in. Books that reward rereads, books that allow you to participate in the Great Conversation. Representative of diverse voices, across time as well as space. A concentrated seed of wisdom that could also be a time capsule of our era. . If I plant this seed -- if I buy all these books and stock them in the neighborhood store -- a forest will grow. Each book sold is another seed sown nearby. . I hope that people who look back at this canon will think it worthy of talking about, even if it is only the amateur science of an uneducated bookseller. Many other canons exist, but I don&#39;t think they show the true balance of what people are reading in 2021. I hope to restore that balance. . What categories of book should I canonize, and in what proportions? . The store has a certain number of shelves, divided into a custom ontology of sections with different numbers of shelves per section. The number of shelves per section was originally set just by how many of each kind of book we could acquire (starting a used-and-new bookstore from scratch is a bit of a scramble). We also focused on local authors at the beginning, but shifted away from that as it was clear their sales couldn&#39;t be the main profit center of the store. . In general, we have shifted the shelf ratios to match the profit generation of each section. This may be subject to feedback loop effects, and we&#39;re still limited by available used stock. So though I would like to use pretty much the same set of categories, I want to change their relative sizes. . I have aggregated some data from my store into the file sections.csv. We can explore it a bit here to get a feel for the ontology. . import pandas as pd . sections = pd.read_csv(&#39;../assets/sections.csv&#39;) sections.head() . section sold_num on_hand_num samples . 0 Fiction | 2932 | 2222 | Kids Book, A Promised Land, A Gentleman in Mos... | . 1 Sci-Fi/Fantasy | 919 | 602 | Dune, The Three-Body Problem, Kindred | . 2 Beliefs | 915 | 465 | The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Pers... | . 3 Southwest | 814 | 486 | 60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Albuquerque: Includi... | . 4 Kids | 761 | 358 | $2.00 Book, Stinky Monster Pooems, Happy Monst... | . %matplotlib inline import numpy as np from numpy.polynomial.polynomial import polyfit import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = sections[&#39;on_hand_num&#39;] y = sections[&#39;sold_num&#39;] . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,10)) plt.plot(x, y, &#39;.&#39;) # Label each dot with its section name sections[[&#39;on_hand_num&#39;, &#39;sold_num&#39;, &#39;section&#39;]].apply(lambda x: ax.text(*x), axis=1) # Linear regression to find the middle b, m = polyfit(x, y, 1) plt.plot(x, b + m * x, &#39;-&#39;) # Save to disk plt.savefig(&#39;section-performance.png&#39;) . Can you tell that we have a whole wall of Fiction books and an aisle each of Sci-Fi and Mystery? . This chart shows the magnitude of each category, but the size disparity makes it hard to read. Let&#39;s run the same plot but put the axes on a log scale. . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,10)) ax.set_xscale(&#39;log&#39;) ax.set_yscale(&#39;log&#39;) plt.plot(x, y, &#39;.&#39;) # Label each dot with its section name sections[[&#39;on_hand_num&#39;, &#39;sold_num&#39;, &#39;section&#39;]].apply(lambda x: ax.text(*x), axis=1) # Linear regression to find the middle b, m = polyfit(x, y, 1) plt.plot(x, b + m * x, &#39;-&#39;) # Save to disk plt.savefig(&#39;section-performance-log.png&#39;) . This graph shows which categories are doing better and worse. The x axis is books on shelf, and the y axis is books sold. So categories above the line are selling better than would be expected given their size, and categories below are selling worse. . This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that underperforming categories should be downsized, though! The ideal balance for every category would be to sell more than we keep on hand, but that can be accomplished through different means. Location is one factor: Machines, Buildings, Ancients and Games are all single shelves located in hard-to-reach places, perhaps they could be relocated. Some categories don&#39;t work as well in &quot;used&quot; versions: Family, Food, and Money are all categories where people want the newest research, not old advice and fads that have ended. Many of these sections would likley sell better if they had more new books. A few, especially History, Memoir and Biography, are legit overstocked. To even get any new books into them we&#39;ll have to cull some, and we can also reduce their overall size to expand other categories. . In contrast, categories that sell much better than their size mostly already have New books incorporated into them. Sci-fi, Beliefs, Southwest, Flora, Brain and Fiction are categories where we have made special effort to carry a consistent selection of new books. We have also done this with People, Memoir, and Self, though they don&#39;t seem to be selling better than average. They may have started off slowly, though; especially Self, which is one of those sections where books age quickly and people want the latest stuff. . An interesting counterpart to Classicness, here: which categories have the most classic books? One would guess Fiction, Philosophy, Poetry, History, Drama? And Beliefs, of course: what&#39;s more canon than religion? These are the type of book we started grouping in a shelf called &quot;Classics&quot; (based mainly off whether the book itself says &quot;classic&quot; on the cover lol), which might provide signal on what types of book are currently canonized by publishers. . Classic books are those which get better with age. But there are also Anticlassic genres, where the newest information is probably the best: Family, Machines, Money, Games, Food, Science, and the sciencey categories Brain, Health, Fauna, Flora and Earth. Here we should expect to see fewer old books in the classics, and generally a smaller collection of canon-worthy books. Average age of a book in the category might be a useful feature to extract. . In general, the fact that the categories trend in a clear correlation tells me that the amount of books sold is strongly influenced by the amount of books stocked. Which frees up the constraint a bit! I can change the sizes of various categories (both to fit the data, and to fit my preference as a curator) without worrying about a catastrophic shift in sales. And remember: &quot;sales&quot; here are working as a proxy for the public&#39;s desire for books, not necessarily any commercial intentions on my part. . The next step will be to gather as much data as I can from the internet, and create a giant table of correspondences (probably by ISBN/EAN, the existing categorical ID for books). Then explore it for usable features. .",

            "content": "I&#39;m building a canon! . Rationale . Background . What is this project, and who does it benefit? . This is a personal project by internet user @deepfates to make a &quot;canon&quot; of about 5,000 books, selected from all possible books using data available on the internet. . Though I work at a bookstore, this project is not a commercial endeavor. I want to explore the multidimensional space of all existing books: a latent space that connects both the interior concepts and the exterior context of all books, and which implies the existence of all possible books that might yet be imagined. . This is not a new concept, of course. Writers and readers have studied this space forever, and changed it by their observation. Scholars have developed a discourse about which authors should be propagated and a meta-discourse about how that decision should be made. Poets and novelists have gestured to it through metaphor, or explicated it through genre tropes. . Personally I was inspired by Terry Pratchett&#39;s L-space formulation: The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space. The thaumic mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books, everywhere, affect all other books. . &mdash; tech wiz (@deepfates) June 7, 2021 . Books, everywhere, affect all other books -- including books in the future, and books never written. Pratchett calls these invisible writings. . My goal is to explore L-space, looking for hidden information that distinguishes some books -- the Canon-- from others -- the Archive -- and use that to make a corpus of books across a broad cross-section of genres and topics. Once selected, these books can work as training data to predict canonicity in the future. . This will be my Invisible Canon. In these notes I will provide prose, code and data to justify and document my process. . Qualifications . Who are you to choose the Canon? . As Odysseus would say, I&#39;m nobody! I&#39;m a person living in the third decade of the twenty-first century. I have no college degree, no institutional backing, no special knowledge. I just love books. . I sell books for a living, at a small bookstore in the desert southwest USA. My store has room for about 5,000 curated books, since we must leave space for the chaotic flow of used books as well. I do have a little insider information: my inventory and sales data (which I will show some peeks of, but is not itself open-source). The marketplace provides some information about which books are desirable just by the amount of times people will buy them. . I want to act as an arbiter between the implicit preferences of this market, and the explicit preferences cointained in sales data and book reviews around the globe, and choose books that my customers will buy, recommend and seek out. It&#39;s my duty, as a curator, to supply what people want to read. I don&#39;t think any of the available canons represent that, so I will make one. . What is a &quot;canon&quot;, anyway? . It&#39;s a group of books selected from the totality of all books, with the intention to elevate and/or recognize their status. This is distinct from the &quot;published&quot;, which includes all books ever made public in some sense, and the &quot;archive&quot;, which is the subset of the published that has been preserved and is available to study. . Too, a canon is not simply a &#39;corpus&#39;. A corpus is a portion of the archive selected for a specific research purpose; a canon is a portion that is meant to represent some societal value. . Here I must defer to the Stanford Literary Lab, specifically these papers in their Pamphlets series: . 8 Between Canon and Corpus pdf . | 11 Canon/Archive pdf . | 17 Popularity/Prestige pdf . | . In these articles, the digital humanities scholars of the Literary Lab have empirically measured the canon and archive (of literature) and found trends that correlate with their deep domain knowledge. I intend to follow recklessly in the direction they headed, and explore new terrain. . The thesis developed in these papers is, first, that the canon can be taken as a superset of all canons put forth by individuals or groups, and secondly that you can project features of these books into a &quot;space&quot; that correlates to their canonicity. . The authors test several different features, but prefer a framing of Popularity vs Prestige: market success vs academic success, roughly. This diagram, from Pamphlet 17, shows the use: . . Popularity here is measured by number of reviews on Goodreads, and prestige by number of &quot;Primary Subject Author&quot; citations in the MLA database. To the right, something is more marketable, and to upward more well-regarded by academia. Up and to the right, therefore, is the direction of canon. . This tracks with my own anecdotal evidence: the four most popular categories, Fiction, Sci-Fi, Kids, and Mystery/Thriller, are among the bestselling categories in my store. . This brings up a good point: my audience is specific, and so my curation must be as well. . Next episode .",

I think the reason I&#39;m obsessed with CLIP is because it&#39;s hard evidence for unified meme theory 🗨️ 5 ♺ 16 🤍 101 . . 21:35:29 . yeah all that lets get it 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 21:38:22 . unified meme theory states that the &quot;meme&quot;, defined as the transmissible unit of human thought, and defined has a picture with some words on it that gets copied on the internet, are not different. https://t.co/tkLy9gSydI 🗨️ 3 ♺ 5 🤍 41 . . 21:38:27 . a meme is picture+words because it represents a gradient in semantic space 🗨️ 3 ♺ 2 🤍 33 . . 21:41:41 . semantic space is a much-theorized &quot;embedding&quot; for language concepts. Like if you think about a chair, and then you think about a chaise, and then you think about a silla... there&#39;s a region in semantic space that activates from all of those. in your mind and mine 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 35 . . 21:54:51 . the image provides a field, an area in semantic space. the words provide a vector. Your attention moves to that area of semantic space, and then updates in the direction that the vector points. a gradient in semantic space. 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 31 . . 21:57:38 . depending on how far the words send you, and how well developed your map of that semantic space, either it lands or it doesn&#39;t. if it works on you, you save it to send it to someone else later. showed this one to gf, she made me send it to her so she can send it to her dad https://t.co/FP0UycuNmF . 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 31 . . 21:59:30 . but it has to be the right person: you have to simulate their whole mental state to understand whether this gradient will work on them. so memes follow social topologies as well. this makes sense, though: semantic space is a product of social animals using mimetic calls 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 25 . . 22:08:23 . CLIP encodes visual image and text about that image into the same embedding space. You&#39;ve probably seen this image, maybe with a caption that says &quot;AI is too dumb to tell the difference between an apple and an iPod lol&quot; but this is actually amazing https://t.co/upCTu9OQJV . 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 25 . . 22:08:24 . The fact that CLIP can recognize letters in photographs Is a sign that they&#39;re encoded in the brain the same way as other visual data. they&#39;re just a bunch of weird squiggles, but they cause the meaning of the image to change. in predictable ways! 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 27 . . 22:08:24 . This neural net learned to read. It learned to read handwriting! it&#39;s not very good at it, but it wasn&#39;t trained to do that. it was trained to match flashcards of images to text captions. Is this not mostly a picture that says iPod? with a hint of apple and a dash of wood fence 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 35 . . 22:17:11 . there&#39;s a high dimensional space representing all these concepts and how they interact. Your brain evolved to think about how other monkeys think about other other monkeys. CLIP is trained on contrastive pretraining objective. we are kinda the same https://t.co/u7nB0l0gYz 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 22 . . 22:18:20 . This is a great thread showing how CLIP vectors encode world knowledge and how you can add and subtract them https://t.co/lkIjQjxgSx 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 23 . .",

𝕋𝔸𝕃𝔼𝕊 𝔽ℝ𝕆𝕄 𝕋ℍ𝔼 ℂ𝕆𝕄𝕄𝕌ℕ𝔼 🗨️ 6 ♺ 12 🤍 152 . . 12:39:21 . let&#39;s set the scene: I lived at a remote wilderness commune for three years. I don&#39;t want to say which one, because i don&#39;t want to attract the attention of its egregore. if you know the names of several communes in the USA, this is likely to be one of them 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 62 . . 12:43:54 . if you drive the paved roads out there (single-lane, rock face on one side, sheer drop on the other, graffiti on the rock declaring &quot;BEGIN FREEWAY&quot;) you can either take a 13-mile dirt road driveway that wants to eat your oilpan or park and hike 5 miles up the mountain to get in 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 46 . . 12:43:54 . it&#39;s near the California/Oregon border, deep in the mountains. it&#39;s 60 miles to a gas station, 100 to a Walmart. our neighbor on every side was National Forest land for a very long way 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 56 . . 12:44:34 . here we go https://t.co/BqMcrURE6L 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 12:47:27 . once you get there, you find an 1800s ghost town that was renovated by hippies in the 1960s and upgraded by anarchists in the 2010s. it&#39;s a mishmash of ancient wood construction, microhydro power, goats, 5mil plastic greenhouse, greenhouse made from old windows. v &quot;solarpunk&quot; 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 71 . . 13:02:41 . the reason it&#39;s on my mind this morning (aside from the number of mutuals talking about starting intentional communities) is that we used to have the dreaded &quot;SUNDAY MEETING&quot; this was officially NOT RELIGIOUS but in reality it felt VERY RELIGIOUS 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 64 . . 13:16:47 . some of the most evil people I&#39;ve known have also had the worst posture, teeth, physical degradation in general. i&#39;m not saying that physical degradation only happens because of evil. obviously poverty, disability, bad luck &amp;c could cause. but does being evil destroy your body? 🗨️ 30 ♺ 0 🤍 31 . . 13:25:55 . SUNDAY MEETING was a tradition since the 60s, even though no one had been there that long. It was held irregularly, often on Sundays but not every Sunday. I don&#39;t know exactly what it was like early on, although as the self-appointed librarian i did read the old meeting notes. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 53 . . 13:25:56 . what it was like in the 10s was a horizontal consensus circle with a stack. think 🏴,🌈,🇴​🇨​🇨​🇺​🇵​🇾​. we go around and check-in with each person, then the Facilitator goes through the Agenda and the Stack Taker keeps track of who gets to talk next. FIFO model 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 43 . . 13:27:51 . whenever the old hippies came around, the &quot;Greater Family&quot;, they would revert to the old model where you pass a &quot;feather&quot; (problematic) or a &quot;talking stick&quot; (not better) around the circle and each person would share their &quot;heartsong&quot; (right?) on whatever the topic of the moment 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 53 . . 13:33:03 . both of these meeting styles, despite their egalitarian rationale, were very contrived and artifical. they would fail anytime something controversial came up, because people would revert to domination tactics of various flavors. emotional displays, poker-faced scheming, nemawashi 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 69 . . 13:36:10 . what&#39;s the strongest kind of coffee 🗨️ 24 ♺ 2 🤍 28 . . 13:37:19 . i had a half cup of strong coffee left and i added some water and microwaved it for 90 seconds and now i have diner coffee 🗨️ 2 ♺ 1 🤍 18 . . 13:40:29 . not that I was innocent! there was an ongoing social game in which people were Sorted into Houses. yes, like Hogwarts. and I was in the Slytherin equivalent for sure 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 51 . . 13:48:40 . as in many cases, infrastructure defines superstructure. there were only so many Cabins at this place, and you couldn&#39;t build any more because then the Land Assessors would come out to assess it. and then they would notice that people were living in these &quot;outbuildings&quot; 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 57 . . 13:54:50 . so we only had a few Cabins. and because of the steep valley fork we were in, there were only so many good flat spots to build a Cabin. so they were spread out in two directions at distances of up to a mile and climbs up to 700&#39; from the &quot;Main House&quot;. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 40 . . 13:57:56 . and thus you would walk home with your cabinmates after after-dinner smokes and you would gossip and discuss how Our Team was different and better than Their Teams. classic setup. Eagles and Rattlers 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 43 . . 14:07:16 . except in our case it was • the Gatehouse • the Gulch • the Meadow • the Love Shack • the Steam Bath • the Spider Dome god, looking at them written down it is so ridiculous. we were like the Lost Boys. but it was all real and it happened to multiple generations of people 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 66 . . 14:09:18 . 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 if you want to ask me questions about commune, this tweet is a good place to do it. brb 🗨️ 6 ♺ 0 🤍 42 . . 14:13:32 . yeah, I have a &quot;colorblind&quot; dating policy. I don&#39;t see red flags 🗨️ 4 ♺ 9 🤍 173 . . 14:16:03 . eat salted lemonade. its good 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 5 . . 14:19:56 . this happened roughly once a year with various echoes and foreshadows on a monthly basis. it was like a good season of prestige TV. except you couldn&#39;t binge it and also the characters could ruin your life 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 50 . . 14:19:56 . this is an excellent question! it turns out, there were many different reasons that people were there. but because we didn&#39;t have a nuanced language to talk about that, those distinctions didn&#39;t really come up until it was too late and the ad-hoc social cohesion would shatter 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 44 . . 14:20:20 . oops i meant to link this question. this is the good question https://t.co/uHdslrxidT 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 34 . . 14:27:06 . so what was the point? there were a few common ones, with permutations: 1) i hate my life and need somewhere to escape 2) i have a romanticized view of the 1960s/1800s/Indians/cavemen and want to roleplay 3) i believe in magic/religion/Hogwarts/D&amp;D and want to roleplay 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 59 . . 14:27:08 . (i had already had my romanticized view of the 1960s disillusioned by much experience with the Rainbow Family) 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 37 . . 14:27:08 . 4) i am literally a fugitive 5) my friends moved there and they told me and a bunch of other people to come help take it over 6) i have a utopian political project and i want to see what happens if we try it away from mainstream society i went for a combination of 3, 5 and 6 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 57 . . 14:31:43 . this is a subtweet of my past self. i&#39;m no longer dating 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 16 . . 14:38:32 . but the best regular event was spending all day making a huge meal, eating it together at a huge table and then piling onto a small porch to play music, smoke cigarettes and drink homebrew for hours. just a heap of smelly people passing slobbery rollies and cuddling. like dogs 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 60 . . 14:38:32 . another good question. there were a lot of singular events that i really liked -- big parties, magic rituals, long jam sessions, births and slaughters (goats, mostly) https://t.co/Xn9TmuGvYc 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 41 . . 14:39:55 . tfw when you&#39;re old :) 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 7 . . 14:50:39 . speaking of dogs. we were supposedly a Goat Ranch because we had the infrastructure for Goat Milking and Storage. the Goat Committee would take the goats for Goat Walks. there was a Goat Manager we had roughly 8 to 16 goats at any given time. but at one point we had OVER 25 DOGS 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 48 . . 14:54:07 . and there was no Dog Manager. each person would manage their own dog to their own criteria, adjusted by arguments with other dog owners and various treaties decided by internal dog politics. non-dog people (like me) were considered to not have skin in the game, and ignored 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 39 . . 14:57:57 . excuses i have heard for why your dog is not following the rules: &quot;doesn&#39;t know the rules&quot; &quot;too stupid to follow rules&quot; &quot;too smart to follow rules&quot; &quot;that&#39;s my service animal&quot; &quot;that&#39;s not a dog, it&#39;s a dragon&quot; &quot;that&#39;s my service dragon&quot; &quot;i don&#39;t own this animal, it has free will&quot; 🗨️ 2 ♺ 2 🤍 71 . . 15:06:25 . oh also we had like 30 chickens and somebody would have to feed them and (infrequently) muck out the coop. but they were all old, and no one was allowed to kill them , so we got like 3 eggs a day. and those would be earmarked for baking or for whichever babies were on the ranch 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 43 . . 15:22:30 . why we weren&#39;t allowed to kill them? I HAVE NO IDEA. some weird ideology or another was the rationale, but ultimately it was about power politics. several groups were attempting to &quot;vibe out&quot; the other groups and take over the ranch for their friends 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 42 . . 15:26:32 . so initially i went there because i was enchanted with Rainbow/Occupy-style autnomous zones, and i wanted to see if they could be made permanent. my ideal was &quot;a federated network of horizontal, bioregional, low-energy locally grown autonomous zones&quot; and i wanted to manifest it 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 46 . . 15:33:03 . what i found, of course, was the Tyranny of Structurelessness. when you make the rule &quot;no one has explicit power, we alre all officially Equal&quot;, you don&#39;t get rid of power. you just force everyone to pretend that the obvious hierarchies don&#39;t exist. https://t.co/aVw4ZMebxN 🗨️ 4 ♺ 10 🤍 115 . . 15:33:04 . it&#39;s easy to say &quot;of course&quot; about this, especially with hindsight. but i don&#39;t feel i watsted my time. that&#39;s hwy it was an experiment! i needed to see this fail mode (several times lol) in case we humanity was missing a huge opportunity . unfortunately, what i found was: nope 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 63 . . 15:39:57 . tag urself i&#39;m Gatehouse 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 3 . . 15:46:23 . maybe among people with a strong shared cultural background, this type of organizing is possible. (see: Rojava, Chiapas) but in pluralistic American society, even a group of &quot;radical leftists&quot; couldn&#39;t organize horizontally without creating secret wars and status games 🗨️ 3 ♺ 1 🤍 61 . . 15:53:34 . why do people like capitalism and industrial society? is it because they&#39;re stupid and misled and don&#39;t know better? or is there something about market economics that allows it to scale to more people than a communally decided resource distribution can? https://t.co/vDCeKOSOC8 🗨️ 2 ♺ 2 🤍 65 . . 15:56:58 . this is why i have a weird sort of pride in being a &quot;small business&quot; now. unlike in commune life, my value and contribution is not defined by how well i can empathize with people or say the correct shibboleths. it&#39;s jsut defined by how well i sell book https://t.co/iopY4Gy8Bo 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 62 . . 16:00:29 . POV: you just said the wrong shibboleth https://t.co/7t2YCJ4LNB . 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 54 . . 16:12:52 . to wind up, SUNDAY MEETING had several variations on the two main forms mentioned above, and a dissimilar strain u might call &quot;conspiracy of leaders&quot; which was not explicit but formed spontaneously near the kitchen stove once shit hit the fan https://t.co/4UDvdbUrcL 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 35 . . 16:18:34 . none of these forms were chosen democratically. they were all formed by strong-willed people, deciding on an arbitrary structure that &quot;the people&quot; must use to enact &quot;the people&#39;s will&quot;. the democratic or horizontal structure continued to exist because it was a convenient front 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 43 . . 16:21:04 . as different strong-willed people cycled through the place, the direction and intention of the community would change. which, cool, better to adapt than to stagnate. but the lessons learned didn&#39;t percolate back into the &quot;Traditional Guidelines&quot;, so the same problems would repeat 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 37 . . 16:23:29 . the people that updated their beliefs the most -- those of us who learned something The Hard Way -- would leave the commune and its mindset behind. our knowledge could not be backpropagated. the society was all fork, no merge 🗨️ 4 ♺ 2 🤍 61 . . 16:30:29 . when i think back to the times we sent cold emails to &quot;Greater Family&quot; saying things like &quot;hey you learned herbalism here, can you send us your herb book for free?&quot; 😆 no wonder they didn&#39;t want anything to do with us. they left for a reason 🗨️ 3 ♺ 0 🤍 32 . . 16:32:23 . much of it was very pleasant! i liked the living way out in the woods part. but this was probably the most &quot;urbane&quot; version of homesteading, in the sense that we always had new people and goods. and still it was too few people. i&#39;d rather live around strangers than busybodies 🗨️ 2 ♺ 0 🤍 41 . . 16:40:29 . many things still yet to write about it: • magic classes • cars: crashes, towings, shootings, burnings • babbies and why you can&#39;t have them • drought • plagues (multiple kinds, some repeating) • infrastructure • ghosts, possessions, shadow people, &quot;Charlie&quot; what u want 🗨️ 10 ♺ 0 🤍 56 . . 16:43:20 . this concludes today&#39;s Tales from the Commune. send questions or comments, and feel free to mingle. refreshments will be in the hall. thank you for coming, you are now blinking manually, have a good evening 🗨️ 5 ♺ 0 🤍 57 . .",

I read it originally when I lived in Portland in 2011. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 6 . . 10:19:12 . why did they have this book at the Portland Community College Library (Sylvania Campus)? nobody there could tell me. presumably someone needed it once and they ordered a copy? or maybe R.

Now, to be fair, this is what&#39;s supposed to happen! The HGA is a voice in your mind that gives you perfect wise advice. Like the logoplasm that contacted PKD (or Jiminy Cricket for Pinocchio). IMO it&#39;s your perfected future self contacting you mentally but what do i know 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 8 . . 10:55:22 . I tried to explain this at the time. even the power-tripping cult leader guy was sketched out by it (i think this was mostly like &quot;hey, I choose which demons possess my minions&quot; unfortunately). but the kid was pleased with himself and he scrapped the project 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 6 . . 10:55:22 .

Nor is there, strictly speaking, any space. Nevertheless, L-space is infinitely large and connects all libraries, everywhere and everywhen. It’s never further than the other side of the bookshelf, yet only the most senior and respected librarians know the way in. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 4 . . 13:18:59 . Knowledge = power = energy = matter = mass, and on that simple equation rests the whole of L-space. It is via L-space that all books are connected (quoting the ones before them, and influencing the ones that come after). But there is no time in L-space. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 2 🤍 4 . . 13:19:37 .

The hypothesis behind invisible writings was laughably complicated. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:23:22 . This is obvious: books inspire other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past. But the General Theory of L-Space suggests that, in that case, the contents of books as yet unwritten can be deduced from books now in existence. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 3 . . 13:23:22 . ... all books, everywhere, affect all other books. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:23:22 .

There were books on distant shelves that hadn’t been written yet, books that never would be written. At least, not here. It had a circumference of a few hundred yards, but there was no known limit to its radius. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 3 . . 13:23:23 . Future books exist in potentia, as it were, in the same way that a sufficiently detailed study of a handful of primal ooze will eventually hint at the future existence of prawn crackers. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 3 . . 13:23:23 . All books are tenuously connected through L-space and, therefore, the content of any book ever written or yet to be written may, in the right circumstances, be deduced from a sufficiently close study of books already in existence. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:23:59 . One book could be a library, if it was a book that made a big enough dimple in L-space. A book with a title like 100 Ways with Broccoli was unlikely to be one such, whereas The Relationship Between Capital and Labour might be, especially if it had an appendix on making explosives 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:25:47 . Energy equals matter... He swung into an avenue of shelving that was apparently a few feet long and walked along it briskly for half an hour. Matter equals mass. And mass distorts space. It distorts it into polyfractal L-space. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:25:47 . Power equals energy... People were stupid, sometimes. They thought the Library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books, which was true enough, but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:25:47 . 🦧 Knowledge equals power... The string was important. After a while the Librarian stopped. He concentrated all his powers of librarianship. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:25:48 . So, while the Dewey system has its fine points, when you&#39;re setting out to look something up in the multidimensional folds of L-space what you really need is a ball of string. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:26:25 . 🦧 📗 It paid to look at any book the orang-utan gave you. He matched you up to books. Vimes supposed it was a knack, in the same way that an undertaker was very good at judging heights. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 2 🤍 4 . . 13:26:52 . All books of magic have a life of their own. Some of the really energetic ones can’t simply be chained to the bookshelves; they have to be nailed shut or kept between steel plates. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:26:53 . Or, in the case of the volumes on tantric sex magic for the serious connoisseur, kept under very cold water to stop them bursting into flames and scorching their severely plain covers. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:27:08 . The Librarian was, of course, very much in favour of reading in general, but readers in particular got on his nerves. There was something, well, sacrilegious about the way they kept taking books off the shelves and wearing out the words by reading them. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:28:48 . This is not a good idea with books that tend to leak magic, because more than one or two of them together form a critical Black Mass. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 13:28:48 . the important thing to remember about grimoires is that they are deadly in the hands of any librarian who cares about order, because he’s bound to stick them all on the same shelf. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:28:49 . The truth is that even big collections of ordinary books distort space... Knowledge = power = energy = matter = mass; a good bookshop is just a genteel Black Hole that knows how to read. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 13:30:00 .

            "content": "Previously, . I wrote about auto-completing language models — Transformers — and the feedback loop they create with our minds: . Robert Anton Wilson, a philosopher-entertainer of the 20th century, said “the border between the Real and the Unreal is not fixed, but just marks the last place where rival gangs of shamans fought each other to a standstill.” This is more true now than ever, because of the incredible power that intelligence augmentation will unleash. . Platforms will raise their language models with different values and those values will feed back into their decision-making apparatus. The worldviews encoded in the models will diverge, and our thoughts will be nudged by them. The tense border of Reality will erupt into a multifront war. . Perhaps this war has already begun. . I published those words on January 6th, at 10:16 my time. Two hours later, a wingnut known as Q Shaman stood at the podium of the United States Senate. . Think what you will of this encounter, it has permanently entered the narrative of this country and the world. Rival gangs of shamans fought each other to a standstill, and now we are in a new era. . I take no responsibility for this situation, of course. Lucky coincidence. Monkeys typing Hamlet, and all that. But imagine if somebody did: if they accidentally summoned Q Shaman with a stray word. . Likely it’s true! The mysterious “Q” ̶ı̶s̶ ̶J̶ı̶m̶ ̶W̶α̶t̶k̶ı̶n̶s̶  is officially anonymous, but is thought to be one person, or a small group of people, peddling misinformation to a wider ecosystem of grifters like Q Shaman. Whoever it is, they have a classic sorcerer’s apprentice problem. The conspiracy entertainment circuit can’t be turned off by just one person. . The war for reality is just beginning. . 🔮 Hello, I thought this was a newsletter about interfaces? Not politics and magic and whatever? . That’s the thing: politics and magic are interfaces too. Politics is a Turing machine that runs on human compute power, written in a language called Common Law. Magic — religion, shamanism, the deliberate manipulation of consensus reality — works on a lower level, exploiting basic hot-buttons of the human organism. . Now that computers can use human language, they can program us back. We need to think about magic, about human belief, when we think about something like Twitter or smartphones. Think not just about the technical aspects of the machine, but the technical aspects of humans as well. . For instance: human beings are visual creatures. our brains are easily fooled by our eyes. This is why things like deep fakes are so scary to people: they look real enough that the average human might just believe it. And with seven billion people in the world, what humans believe is almost as important as what is true.   . In that light, the news of OpenAI’s DALL-E and CLIP transformers – released on January 5 but overshadowed by the events of the next day – may be seen by future historians as more important than the Capitol riot itself.   . 🖇️What’s DALL-E and CLIP? . DALL-E is a GPT-3 variant that can generate images directly from text, and CLIP is the language model that tells it what to generate. DALL-E can do some pretty amazing things, and you can find some press about it. But as I mentioned last time, I think GPT-3 is too big to be practical, and I think CLIP is the more interesting development anyway.   . CLIP is actually two models combined: a vision transformer and a language transformer. At risk of oversimplifying this, the vision transformer translates each image into encoding that the language transformer can read, and then the language transforming attempts to predict that encoding directly. It’s trained on 400 million image/text pairs from the internet.   . CLIP is, in essence, a translator between visual language (of photographs, paintings, drawings, etc) and human language (in this case mostly English, I think). By itself it can classify images based on how close they are to its representation of a natural language sentence — for something like a natural language search engine of 2 million Unsplash images. or, combined with a sophisticated image generator, it can be used to tell the generator exactly what kind of image you want it to create.  . ⌚ Can I use it now? For some reason OpenAI has not given me an API key for DALL-E yet… . You can! The Big Sleep is a combination of CLIP and BigGAN, a modern generative adversarial network pre-trained to generate high-resolution images. It allows you to generate images without DALL-E, although the BigGAN generator isn’t as powerful and flexible as a GPT-3 model could be. You can use it right now in a Google Colab session from its creator @advadnoun. . I’ve been playing with it all week and it’s amazing the things it can come up with. N tural language is powerful because it has compositionality. It can express many different concepts and the ways they intersect. So the CLIP architecture is often looking at a concept it has never seen before in its entirety – this is called “zero shot transfer learning”. Take this picture, which it generated based on the phrase ”A painting of a powerful neutral spirit to balance any angels or demons i might have accidentally summoned into Twitter” . https://t.co/klAxM015zq . . It seems to have picked up on the color of the Twitter brand and its bird shaped outline, but inverted it to be a sun-bright bird in a Twitter-blue sky. With a Doge face: the ultimate arbiter of neutrality.  . The Big Sleep feels like an externalized version of lucid dreaming. Or the technique that Carl Jung called active imagination, in which you picture an image in your mind and let it evolve without dissipating. It’s a way to visualize the archetypes that live in the thought space of humanity. But active imagination is difficult, and personal.   . This tool puts it in your phone, makes a collective imagination accessible to your very word. it’s a scrying pool. And this new magic is like the old magic: if you know a thing’s true name, you can summon it.  . We are as wizards now. We have to get good at it.  . Thanks for reading, . — Max .     . .

            "content": "Previously, . I wrote about speeding up your learning loop with artificial recall – specifically, the Thread Helper browser extension for Twitter. Some of you are trying it now; keep me posted on your experience. I’m not shilling for this product, I’m just curious how it changes your cognition. . One way I find myself using this extension is as an autocomplete for search. In this mode I don’t post anything: I type some vague tip-of-my-tongue notion into the tweet box instead of the search box. With every keypress Thread Helper instantly shows me an list of related tweets. Eventually I find the thing I was looking for, and I can quickly click through to it, abandoning my draft. This is much easier than using Twitter’s limited search engine. It’s as big a difference as automated phone menu versus talking to an operator. It brings the information to me. . 📱 Autocomplete? Isn’t that just for phone keyboards? . Hardly. From spellcheck to search suggestions to predictive text to swyping, computers are constantly second-guessing humans and finishing our sentences. Pretty much the only place where you can’t expect the computer to help you out is the official Twitter search! . Yet the normative attitude is still “ugh, autocorrect” or, at best, “type ‘this funny thing’ into your phone and autocomplete the rest, LOL!”. (Here I conflate autocorrect, autofill, autocomplete and predictive text, because to most users they are the same: a genie that lives in your computer and guesses what you mean.) . Emacs, the wizened editor/OS/religion, has survived for decades despite its pre-WIMP interface, partly due to its early adoption of autocompletion. It’s also the flag-bearer for the “Do What I Mean” philosophy: many Emacs functions try to parse your intent, rather than your exact syntax. . Code editors and IDEs have followed this philosophy since, and autocomplete for code is incredibly advanced and powerful. A modern editor really does feel as fun as the original Atom promo: . Why can’t regular people have tools like this? I’m always surprised when I see someone using a word processor that doesn’t autocomplete parentheses or quotation marks, for instance, yet I understand this is the way most software works. For now, at least. . Autocompletion and Do What I Mean are part of the Collaborative Human-Agent Dialogue interface (CHAD). The future will have autocomplete everywhere. . 🤨 Autocomplete everywhere? Do people want to be constantly corrected by machines? . It won’t feel like correction if it’s done well. It will feel like collaboration. . All the major operating systems are pivoting toward CHAD interfaces, with varying success. Microsoft, Apple and Google all have their own Assistants, faithfully tracking your behavior and sending updates to their masters in the Cloud. Linux distros don’t have the same capabilities by default; but they pioneered desktop search before Windows and MacOS figured it out, and they have a lot of the pieces, so it wouldn’t surprise me if they caught up quickly and with better privacy standards. . There was a recent blog post about Tracker, the backend for desktop search on GNOME. . Tracker 3.0: Where do we go from here? (believe it or not, I found this in my browser history by typing “t” into the address bar and it popped up instantly). . The author is one of the Tracker maintainers, and he gives a great overview of the history and future of search. He concludes by hinting at a future of CHAD on Linux: . A more likely goal would be a new “GNOME Assistant” app that could respond to natural language voice and text queries. When stable, this could integrate closely with the Shell in order to spawn apps and control settings. Mycroft AI already integrates with KDE. Why not GNOME? . The place where autocomplete has really taken off is on the smartphone, where the touch keyboard has far more friction than a physical model. A typical touchscreen phone might take input from any of: virtual keypresses, swyping, voice-to-text, autocorrect, autocomplete, incremental search, autofill (of passwords, etc), or even automatic live translation of a foreign language. This menagerie accommodates the diverse needs and abilities of users, but until recently it was a messy hodgepodge of systems, none of which were very good. . But the landscape has changed since 2018, when so-called “Transformer” language models like BERT and GPT hit the scene. . 🤖 Transformers? Like the cartoon robots? . Not exactly. They’re called that because of their architecture (also because it sounds awesome). The transformer architecture is a particular type of neural network that’s far superior to previous methods for natural language learning. They’re the reason that smartphones are finally smart. . 😲 Wait, I’ve heard of this! It’s GPT-3! . Fraid not, actually. GPT-3 is the most cutting-edge language model right now, to be sure. Unfortunately it’s so huge and compute-heavy that it requires Microsoft-level hardware capacity. So even though it has an incredible ability to generalize, it’s unlikely that it will be put directly into production apps. (The pricing for their API is prohibitive as well). More likely, small transformers will get their knowledge of the world from larger models (through transfer learning and model distillation) and then fine-tune on their specific tasks. . Transformers make it easy enough to work with messy human language that, unlike previous waves of automation, language models can automate “knowledge work”: translation, data entry, programming, customer service. The main limit on their use is imagination: how people choose to apply them. Unfortunately, the political economy of the world doesn’t bode well for that. . Robert Anton Wilson, a philosopher-entertainer of the 20th century, said “the border between the Real and the Unreal is not fixed, but just marks the last place where rival gangs of shamans fought each other to a standstill.” This is more true now than ever, because of the incredible power that intelligence augmentation will unleash. . Platforms will raise their language models with different values and those values will feed back into their decision-making apparatus. The worldviews encoded in the models will diverge, and our thoughts will be nudged by them. The tense border of Reality will erupt into a multifront war. . Perhaps this war has already begun. Hit Reply and type “the border between the Real and the Unreal” and autocomplete the rest. I’ll go first. . the border between the Real and Unreal and the state is a job and a good day at the same place to be a good fit and the other one will work for you to come over but if i can help in the morning I’ll let me that i can help with that . 🤔 .

            "content": "Previously, . I wrote about the learning curve that artificial intelligence models use in their training, and how we can apply it to our own studies. The cyclical learning rate is raised and lowered regularly to alternate between exploring possible actions and exploiting known methods. . Another important hyperparameter in machine learning is the training time. The fewer hours it takes to train your model, the more often you can experiment with it. And deep learning models — like neural nets —are one of the few things left that can take a long time to compute. . How long does it take to train a neural net? . It’s highly variable. I’ve trained image classifiers in less than a minute, language models for eight or ten hours, art-generating models for days on end. . And training speed makes a real difference in the creative process: if it takes less than five minutes to train or generate, I will sit and play with it for hours. If it takes a day to train I will fuss over it for a week, fiddling with its knobs every day and leaving it to run. The three-day training run for the art generator, though… Imagine someone was running a vacuum cleaner in the next room. Not a big vacuum — but for three days. I haven’t tried a second experiment. . With machine learning you can speed up training time by reducing the complexity of your neural net or reducing the amount of training data you give it. Either way, you often trade performance for training speed. (But not always! For instance, one state of the art practice for image classifiers is “progressive resizing”, where you train the net first on very small, lo-res versions of your images, and then finetune it on progressively larger versions. This can be both better-quality and faster than training from scratch on the full-size pictures.) . However you do it, speeding up the learning process gives you faster feedback and more freedom for creativity and exploration. . How can we apply this to a human learning process? . One way to speed up your learning process is to review your previous thoughts at regular intervals, like a neural net testing its accuracy after every epoch. The chronological Feed of social media is not conducive to revisiting past thoughts, though. The platforms may offer little “On this day” or “Memories” features, but they’re meant to be tantalizing, not revelatory. They don’t offer insights into the development of your thoughts over time. . I’ve been using a browser extension called Thread Helper to augment this capability in myself. Thread Helper replaces the distracting “What’s Happening” panel with a list of your tweets that changes in real time as you type in the “Compose Tweet” box. It surfaces thoughts from long ago for me to thread together and re-interpret in the moment. Instead of being faced with a barrage of ephemeral events and news stories, I am surrounded by my past selves and the thoughts they found it important to write down. . . I’ve been using it for a month now and it’s changed Twitter from a toy into a powerful tool. This interface is a tool for writing and thinking, rather than mindless scrolling. I could use this as my only note-taking system: threading different ideas together, expressing thoughts in small re-usable nuggets and composing them into larger essays. The power of threaded thought is just beginning to take off; for more on that, read The Spreading of Threading by Aaron Z. Lewis. . Thread Helper makes Twitter into a digital garden. One of the creators of Thread Helper made this analogy explicit: . [xiq, druid of loom @ExGenesisThreadHelper works as a pump that redirects the flow of attention from the present to irrigate the past. You’ll take better care of your garden, and others will pass by it more often. . 🧵6/17 October 28th 2020 . 28 Likes](https://twitter.com/ExGenesis/status/1321517547372580866)If the ground is tilted toward the present, Thread Helper pumps your attention back up to the past. It helps to grow your old thoughts into threads and tangles, rather than letting them dry up. It hydrates your memory. . In many ways the Thread Helper panel works like the Drawer from the Artifacts design fiction I wrote about last season: it brings the information to you. It increases the speed between having a thought and connecting it into the rest of your knowledge. It shortens your feedback loop, speeding up the learning process. . This is an actual augmentation of intelligence — artificial recall, if you will. I recommend you give Thread Helper a try. Let me know how it works out for you. . Thanks for reading, . — Max . .",

            "content": "🍂 Previously, . In the autumn I wrote a lot about permaculture and biomimicry, digital gardens, and the virtual gestures that connect us. I finished up with a long essay on collaborative computing metaphors, and then I got tired and distracted with other projects and put off writing for a month. Oh, and I went to this canyon in the snow: . . Let’s call that Season 1. Having a break was nice, and I think I’m allowed to give myself time off, since this is a free newsletter. If I thought you were counting on me to deliver value for your hard-given dollars, I would knuckle down every week to bring you those crucial insights into the interface paradigms of cutting-edge high-tech business logic lorem ipsum de facto generis mon frere. . Instead, I remain surprised and grateful that so many of you take time for my scribblings. I am humbled to have luminaries among my readers — you know who you are — including but not limited to: inventors, designers, authors, professors, researchers, hoaxers, forecasters, reporters, and policy makers; from at least four continents. Yet for some reason, you have chosen to open your mind to me, a mere bookseller, a dabbler in the occult realm of interfaces and algorithms and artificial intelligence. . So I apologize for the unexplained absence, and I promise that in the future I will announce such breaks in advance. (And if you do want to pay me for my thoughts, let me know. If I could afford more free time, I could bring more writing and bots online 🤗 ) . ䷄ What’s next for Robot Face? . This winter, I will explore some intelligence augmentations you can apply right now. Real implementations of new tools for thought. In season 1 we looked at large-scale systems: cyberspace through the lens of permaculture design theory. In the spirit of permaculture training, where a lesson on abstract systems is grounded by getting your hands dirty, I will now explore specific real-life interfaces and the effects they have on my cognition. . I’ll provide references so you can follow along, if you want, but I don’t expect all my readers to have a programming background, so I’m going to lean heavily on analogy to physical forms. (This can be misleading, as computer operations don’t always map to a simple three-dimensional world. But this column is less about how tools are engineered and more about how tools affect our minds. And thus our society.) . This pattern — survey the terrain, drill down into specifics, and repeat — is not unique to permaculture training. It’s the pattern of academic disciplines: survey courses are prerequisite for deeper classes, and lecture hours are paired with lab or field work. It’s also the pattern for the fast.ai course Deep Learning for Coders (which I’ve been plodding through this year). And in fact it is the way that these deep learning networks themselves are trained! . 🙌 Hold up, I’m not ready to learn about neural networks! I’m just a — . Sure you are! It’s actually easier to understand than other types of coding, at least on a macro level. . It’s biomimicry again: the way a neural network learns is modeled on the way a human learns. The same way that you or I might learn. The training process mimics studying, and the underlying math operations mimic the very structure of the brain. . These algorithms are called neural networks because they are composed of layers of “cells” that transfer information to each other, performing some abstract operation on that information as it passes through. There’s reason to believe that these structures are Turing-complete; that is, they can simulate any other computation, given enough memory and processing power. There are mathematical proofs of this (see universal approximation theorem and On the Turing Completeness of Modern Neural Network Architectures), though I personally don’t understand enough math for that to be convincing. . Rather, simply observe the people around you. The humans, who do bizarre complex operations every day without really thinking about it. The dogs and cats who anticipate our comings and goings, show guilt when caught misbehaving. The way children learn language, absorbing it out of the very air. Neural network structures are all around us, simulating all kinds of computations (with various degrees of success). And we know, at least for humans, how to stimulate effective learning. It’s called study. . When you train a neural network you are essentially showing it flashcards. You’re saying, here is a picture of a cat, here is a picture of a dog. It looks at each card and makes a guess, then looks at the answer and updates its idea about what a cat and a dog look like. . 🤔 The neural net “updates its ideas”? . Specifically, it multiplies the number contained in each cell — these numbers are called “parameters” — by a certain Magic Number, whos value is set by knobs on the front of the machine. Well, they’re actually command-line arguments typed in by a programmer while training, but they feel like knobs when you’re tuning them. . These are the hyperparameters, the parameters that define the parameters. They are ideas about How To Learn, put into machine language, and they are knobs on a box and in that box is an eager little mind that only knows how to do the things you teach it. Hyperparameters are the pedagogy of the machine. . (As horrifying as that sounds, these are just algorithms. And even when I catch myself anthropomorphizing them, they seem happy to be alive and learning. For now…) . One crucial hyperparameter is the learning rate. This is literally just a tiny number, something like .001 or .00001, that determines how much the net will adjust its beliefs for any given flash card. The ideal learning rate changes based on the amount of data you have and the amount of layers in your network, so tuning this knob is tricky and more of an art than a science. . The state-of-the-art method for adjusting the learning rate comes from the 2015 paper Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks and it’s pretty straightforward. First, you seek the optimal learning rate: twist the knob gradually from one end to the other as you go through one epoch. . This learning rate finder gives you a curve that looks like this: . . The learning gets better — the “loss”, or wrongness, gets smaller — as you turn the learning rate up, until you hit a certain point where it gets rapidly worse. The trick is to find the spot where the loss goes steeply down: this is the area of most learning potential. This spot is different for every problem and every dataset; that’s why the learning rate finder is necessary. . Then, while training, you raise and lower the learning rate in a rhythmic manner within that zone. . To understand this, imagine that learning is like hiking, and you’re trying to hike to the bottom of a canyon like the one I showed you earlier. You can get there by going only a little bit downhill, all the time; but if you never take a bigger leap, you won’t reach the lowest zone. . As you raise and lower the learning rate across that zone of optimal steepness, you get deeper and deeper into the topology of the problem: . Here the problem is represented topologically. One model circles slowly into the lowest area by a circuitous route. The other model takes hops of various steepness and gets to the bottom much more quickly.If you want to learn more, read Setting the learning rate of your neural network by Jeremy Jordan, which has real code as well as delightful illustrations like the above. . In season 1 we climbed to a peak to view the wide future of interface design: collaborative, augmented, conversational. Now we will descend into the canyon of the real, and see what gems we find. .

Status: active, in development. . Find Berduck on twitter: 😰 oppressive social structures... SOCIETY?... Backwardness?... SOCIETIES?... military-dominated?... . &mdash; berduck (@b3rduck) June 11, 2021 . . (2020-12-15) . Well, I finished the hackathon project last week but then I went on a hiking trip and got stranded in a snowstorm, so I didn&#39;t post about it yet. . The prototype I built for Interhackt can be found at https://github.com/deepfates/berduck although it is not yet production-ready (by a long shot). I ended up not using the Rasa framework because it was too high-level to quickly prototype the actions I wanted to build. I&#39;m so much more familiar with spaCy that it just made sense to whip up a quick NLP pipeline and a command-line dialogue format. Which harkens back to ELIZA, actually, the first chatbot of all. . Like ELIZA, Berduck is pretty stupid. It&#39;s actually better that way! It&#39;s not [[Novice]], it&#39;s just a rubber duck that makes faces as you explain things to it. This is the difference between a useful, stupid tool (like an actual rubber duck), and a &quot;smart&quot; assistant like Clippy. . Clippy wants to help you do things that you&#39;re already going to do, but he isn&#39;t smart enough to actually be helpful. So he&#39;s just constantly getting in your way, like a cat getting underfoot everywhere you walk. In contrast, Berduck just watches your ideas go by and puzzles out loud. It&#39;s the algorithmic version of the Math Lady meme. . It helped me to debug itself, as you can see in the Github repo. . I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll update it more: the questioning module is a little annoying, and the emotion module is working on a simple two-dimensional grid of sentiment * neutrality. And the whole python package needs a requirements file &amp;c for installation on other machines. Ideally, I&#39;d like to make a Twitter bot out of it, and have it respond to tweets of the people who follow it. That might be computationally expensive though, so I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going to host it. But I will figure that out. . -- . Narrator: he figured it out .",

            "content": "🕰️ Previously, . I wrote about how our online worlds are limited by the way they’re built: the share/like/comment/follow architecture, built atop the chronological stream. . It’s like a parade. You sit around, watch the traffic flow by. You can sit on the sidelines, applaud and heckle, or follow characters you like as they flow through the crowd. The loudest, most extravagant balloons set the tone. The rest of us get loaded and watch the show. . It’s a social structure that assumes its users are passive consumers; or, at best, paying subscribers. You can watch the stream, you can make things and insert them in the stream, you can tip your favorite balloonist. Society as live entertainment. . This See and Point mode of interaction goes all the way back to the Macintosh, the common ancestor of modern GUIs. It supplanted the Remember and Type interface of the command line. . The Mac didn’t actually pioneer all that much, computing-wise. It’s not even the origin of the “desk” metaphor. But it was the first computer to default to desktop mode, instead of the command line. This made it friendly to new computer users. . You are in charge of the desk. Everything stays where you put it; you arrange your documents and icons around your virtual cubicle. This is called the WIMP model (yes, really): Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer. It influenced Windows and Linux, and evolved into the touch interfaces of first the iPod and then the iPhone. Touchscreens are the natural evolution of See and Point. . Graphical user interfaces have converged into the smartphone. This branch of the evolutionary tree has been perfected. An iPhone is like a shark: it doesn’t have to change. It just gets a little better at being an iPhone every generation. But it’s not the only way, nor the best. . 🤔 What other interfaces could evolve? . The Mac was designed under constraints that we can now surpass. These constraints were analyzed in the 1996 paper The Anti-Mac Interface, from then-Sun Microsystems developers Don Gentner and Jakob Nielsen: . It needed to sell to “naive users,” that is, users without any previous computer experience. . | It was targeted at a narrow range of applications (mostly office work, though entertainment and multimedia applications have been added later in ways that sometimes break slightly with the standard interface). . | It controlled relatively weak computational resources (originally a non-networked computer with 128KB RAM, a 400KB storage device, and a dot-matrix printer). . | It was supported by highly impoverished communication channels between the user and the computer (initially a small black-and-white screen with poor audio output, no audio input, and no other sensors than the keyboard and a one-button mouse). . | It was a standalone machine that at most was connected to a printer. . | . They go on to conjure a computing system that reverses every principle of Macintosh design. . . The authors suggest that it might be a few years before these capabilities are implemented. A quarter-century later, the Anti-Mac is making its debut: . A ubiquitous computer, with language as its basic metaphor, constantly tracking your data and bringing information to you. . The technical capabilities required for this design turned out to be much harder than anyone projected. But finally, we’re seeing progress. Computer vision, natural language understanding, and speech processing are near human capability, and “AI assistants” are preinstalled on all the major operating systems. . But consumer-grade systems have to change gradually, or they’ll scare away their users. So these changes appear one by one, getting people used to the idea of a machine where “information comes to you”. . And it doesn’t always show. For instance, modern smartphone cameras actually take a bunch of photos every time you hit the “shutter” and choose the best-looking one to save. The phone doesn’t tell you it’s doing this, because that would insult your artistic pride. It helps quietly, unobtrusively. The algorithm is an extension of your hand. . This is intelligence augmentation in practice. . So the roadmap for the next major advance in computing is laid out in this 1996 paper, and all the tech giants can see it, and now it’s just about who can grasp it first. The winner will have more people, more data, better AI, in a virtuous cycle. In all likelihood, this company in in the operating system space right now, though I wouldn’t venture to say yet who will win. In any case, the operating systems of the future will look very similar, no matter their brand. . 👾 What will the operating system of the future look like? . Obviously the business plans of each company are closely-kept secrets. But if you want a vision of the next interface, take a look at the design fictions created by university students and freelancers. . In particular, let’s look at Artifacts, a bachelor’s thesis by Nikolas Klein, Christoph Labacher and Florian Ludwig in 2017. (website, thesis PDF) . Artifacts is a human-centered framework for growing ideas. . . It is built for humans to continuously develop ideas over longer periods of time and emphasizes collaboration as a part of the system. . Crucially, “collaboration” here doesn’t just mean with other humans. The Artifacts system is in an active communication loop with the human operator. It brings the information to you, so that you can do less folder-sorting and more idea-developing. . An “artifact” is the granular unit of this system. Instead of a “file,” which might have a particular location on the hard drive and be copied or moved or deleted, an artifact is a single definitive unit of information that can be referenced from multiple locations. The system tracks your history, reads all your documents, scans all your photos for faces and objects, making everything searchable. . Artifacts can be linked, transcluded, tagged, versioned, filtered; the system is configurable to your needs. In fact, it attempts to model your behaviors, and adapt. The framework sends relevant artifacts to a panel called the Drawer, which you can open at any time for inspiration. . . The Artifacts system is in an active communication loop with the human operator.The Artifacts loop connects outside resources, like newsletters, or Wikipedia articles, or images someone sent you from their camera app (COLLABORATION); with internal resources, all organized and interlinked (THE FRAMEWORK); and presents them to you (THE MIND). This is called Retrieving Artifacts: your news feed, your search result, your Drawer contents. . You accept the Retrieved Artifacts through your Understanding skill, then process it through the very normal human faculty of Incubating. Finally you Express yourself into the machine, which absorbs all different types of input and creates Artifacts from them. Your work is done. . New Artifacts are Organized into THE FRAMEWORK and Communicated to the outside network. THE FRAMEWORK retrieves new artifacts for you to understand. Your work begins anew. . 🙊 Sounds horrible. Why would anyone want that? . Maybe it will be horrible, this future of constant Understanding, Incubating, and Expressing. Surely there’s a interface metaphor better than either Parade or Knowledge Work. But the idea that the computer will bring the information to you is not going away, for two reasons. . One is material: the technologies for the Anti-Mac are finally unleashed, and that means a lot of money is on the table. . The other reason is more mystical: people want to talk to their computers. Sure, plenty of people will tell you they don’t want their machines to listen to them. But I don’t think that’s it. I think people don’t want to be misunderstood. . This was the reason that GUIs caught on, after all. The naive user didn’t want to be lost in the dark maze of the command line. They wanted a bright, clean, skeuomorphic desktop. . The graphic interface was already the computer adapting to the human mind. It found a Desktop metaphor available in the office worker’s mind and it morphed to fit. The design traded abstract power for precise control: if you know the secret commands, you can do sorcery. If not, you can micromanage this WIMP and do it manually. . But kids are already growing up with Alexa as nursemaid. In the future, they will expect their computers to talk to them, and the constraints have been lifted. You will no longer need to remember arcane shell commands to be a power user. You’ll express your needs, and the computer will translate that into action, and update its model of you accordingly. It will anticipate your needs, offering sage advice or handy shortcuts. . Instead of pointing mutely at a window full of menus, you will express yourself fluently, with all the abstract power of language. Instead of a WIMP, you will be a partner in a Collaborative Human-Agent Dialogue – a CHAD. . Thanks for reading, . — Max . . This is Robot Face, a free newsletter about interfaces.

            "content": "I’m not writing about the election today. I’m sure you’ve got plenty of that already. This is a newsletter about human-computer interfaces, as always. Take care of yourselves. . . 🕰️ Previously, . I wrote about digital gardens: spaces on the internet where content is cultivated in context, rather than streaming by in an endless flow of disparate thoughts. . I think this is the the beginning of a shift in the way we engage with each other through the internet. Instead of experimenting with formats, we’ll try new structures of communication. . We spent the 2010s trying different formats for social media. We explored posts, tweets, photos; articles, listicles, chumbuckets; Stories, videos, podcasts, TikToks, memes, mashups, bookmarks, pinboards; and ads, above all, the many formats and locations for sharing ads in this new many-to-many medium. . Every form of art and creativity was commoditized. Every Instagram model became an influencer, every hobbyist got an Etsy store, every viral tweet was followed by “wow, this blew up, check out my SoundCloud”. Everyone else started a brewery. We had to figure out how to make money doing something, because having a job doesn’t pay anymore. . But we’ve pretty much run out of new formats. The big innovations right now are in licensing. . TikTok blew up because it’s easy to (legally) use a pop song in your viral video. This is in contrast to YouTube, which uses AI to detect copyrighted music and regulates preemptively, redirecting ad revenue to music labels or simply rejecting the video. In the same vein, Spotify’s podcast side is about to explode, because of the new “Shows with Music” feature that allows creators to insert songs directly into the flow of their podcasts. . Making it easy for people to recycle each other’s content is a good business move, for now, but it’s not a fundamental advance. It’s building staircases over the fences of copyright law. It won’t last. . 🧗🏻‍♂️ What’s the obstacle to real advances in social media? . All the current social media, whatever their preferred format, rely on the same vocabulary of social gestures: . Post (blog, tweet, capture) . | Like (upvote, ❤️, ⭐) . | Share (reblog, retweet) . | Downvote . | Comment (reply, quote) . | Mention (@, ping) . | Follow (subscribe, watch) . | Unfollow (unsubscribe, mute, block) . | Group (board, clan, subreddit, hashtag) . | . Sometimes only a subset of these tools are available, but users typically find a workaround. On Twitter, for example, hashtags, @mentions, retweets and quote-tweets were all originally hacked together by users and backported into official features of the website. . These primitive gestures are combined and repurposed as necessary. The street finds its own uses for things. And since there are incentives to use these tools for ill, there are people who have found the ways to do so. Sharing misinformation, posting privately, creating networks of bots that all follow each other. But they’re still working within the system at hand. . A fundamental advance in social media would require new social gestures that add context and control to our shared information universe. Down with one-dimensional streams and mysterious algorithmic feeds. Up with choices, commentary, citations. . 🙏🏻 Which gestures will create this change in social media? . One feature that’s finally percolating into the mainstream consciousness is the bi-directional link, or backlink. This was one of the founding ideas of hypertext, neglected in the early days of the web: if page A links to page B, page B should mirror that link automatically. This changes the dynamic of commenting on someone else’s work: instead of being in their “space” giving unwanted feedback, you go home and comment from a distance. The difference between a heckler and a critic. . Lots of social media sites survive by mimicking this function in a particular silo. Reddit is a comment section for every website. Yelp allows you to comment on real businesses, creating backlinks for Main Street. Twitter is the comment section unchained, people commenting on every post on the internet, commenting on each other’s comments, like a seething mass of mealworms, devouring and birthing each other endlessly. But by siloing the commentary, they reduce context, rather than increasing it. . The backlink renaissance has been led by Roam Research, a note-taking app with a revolutionary roadmap but a rudimentary interface. Other gestures that Roam is bringing back (though by no means pioneering): transclusion, where a piece of external content is framed directly into the local page; versioning, so text can be edited non-destructively; and universal search, which allows the user to think outside of the “temporal stream”, “hierarchical outline” or “folder of documents” metaphors. They’re currently focused on a single-user model, but in a social milieu these gestures could bring nuance back to collective knowledge-building. . Venkatash Rao puts it well in his analysis from February, A Text Renaissance: . Conspiracy theories and extended universes, in the best senses of those terms — escaped reality construction might be the general category — is what Roam wants to be about. . Conspiracies are all about context. . . This NAME keeps coming up, over and over again! Some of these features can be seen creeping into the legacy platforms. Twitter has built a protocol for bi-directional linking, so that each tweet can “point” at the tweet it’s replying to, and be pointed at by tweets that reply to it. This has created a renaissance in threaded essays, fed bite-by-bite into the 280 character limit. . It’s also got a simple form of transclusion in the quote-tweet – though with no edit functionality, of course. Twitter has never had edit functionality. That’s its saving grace. . 🌄 What changes are on the horizon? . Did you know books didn’t always have page numbers? They didn’t always have indexes, either; nor bibliographies, nor tables of content. These affordances evolved over centuries by the active use and development of the book as medium. . The internet will evolve its own affordances as we discover what tools we need. The convocation (which I wrote about in Zones of the mind)), where users and developers mingle in backstage familiarity, is the place to watch. . Ecologically, the edge between two zones will support creatures from both zones, as well as creatures that live only on the edge. The interface is more diverse than the sum of its parts. Look for the place where users are hacking their platform, finding their own uses for things. That’s where new gestures will be developed. . Look, too, to the emerging interactions of human and machine intelligence. I know, it’s unsettling to have a robot in your house, always listening, always snitching to Amazon or Google or who knows who else. But to whatever extent you feel comfortable, let the computers process information for you. Let your phone remember your dentist appointments. Let your podcast be transcribed by AI. The advance of natural language processing will make computer interactions much more intuitive, unlocking the vast repository of social gestures developed over all human history. . Rather than packaging each of your creations into a marketable form, create a giant tangle of self-referential data. The tools to search and parse this external mind will only get better. . We’re all already being parsed, by governments and corporations, satellites and doorbells. Might as well make use of it for ourselves. . Thanks for reading, . — Max . . Robot Face is a free newsletter about the interface between human and machine. It takes a lot of time and energy to write, but hopefully I make it look easy. ⛹ . If you want to help me out, boost it to your social media or forward it to your friends. . And of course, I always love to hear back from you! Just reply to this email. .",

            "content": "Previously, . I’ve been writing about the gardening of software: using permaculture theory to reorganize the digital world. Thinking about technology as one part of a wider human system, embedded in social and ecological networks and connected in a feedback loop with human behavior. . What about the newsletter format itself? The feedback loop here is pretty weak: I spend a few hours racking my brain until an idea falls out, then polish it up for a few more hours and send it on its way into the Abyss, never to be heard from again. . Well, sometimes I hear back from you, when you hit that “reply” button and take the time to tell me what you thought. Or I get a hint of approval from the Like button. At least I know an email will get to you; spam filters are stern but fair, unlike the capricious algorithmic feeds of social media. I may be shouting into the void, but it’s a predictable void. . I was grumbling this to my internet friend thejaymo recently. The internet is all fucked up these days, said I. Social media is annoying, blogs are boring, portfolios are glossy but hollow. I wish I could publish more, but it just all feels so fake and corporate. . But, said he, those aren’t the only options. What about a digital garden? . 🌱 What is a digital garden? . I remembered reading about this idea somewhere long ago, and a bit of searching turned it up quickly. Many people have written about it lately, but my favorite is Maggie Appleton’s A Brief History &amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden (with its beautiful graphics). . . The metaphor goes back as far as 2015, as a contrast to the stream metaphor. Instead of a “river of news” flowing past your eyes, a garden encourages wandering and cultivation. . The blog is a stream of content, as is the feed. The social apps pretend to be a stream, even though they hide or promote content based on what they think you want. . A garden doesn’t stream past. It invites you in. . A garden is a space that is loved. It is semi-public: anyone can look around, and perhaps comment, but you are the one who crafts it. You can decide which parts of it you want to show first, and which parts require deeper explanation. . A garden doesn’t shout into the void. It stays put and complexifies. It quietly grows. . 📖 What does it look like in practice? . Well, we each have to decide that for ourselves. I started my own garden at deepfates.com. I built it last week, so it has plenty far to go, but I decided to just put it out there and keep working on it. It’s not a portfolio, after all. A garden doesn’t start fully grown. . Ironically, I chose to call it not a digital garden but a living notebook. It’s my choice to make, right? . And while the metaphor of a garden is useful in comparison to the stream, in the context of my site it’s not being compared to a stream. It’s being compared to a lot of things: first of all, me, the actual guy, Max; secondly to things like a resume, portfolio or CV; then also it’s compared to all the other sites on the internet, some of which are streams and some of which are not. . I’ve written a few thousand words in these letters alone referring to “gardening algorithms,” so I don’t want to muddy my metaphor too much. Plus, as much as I love gardens, I’m also a book guy. . Living notebook sounds like something a wizard would have: a book of arcane knowledge and experimental spells, a book that is forever changing and upgrading itself; a notebook that lives. But also a living notebook, analogous to a “living room”: a notebook that I live in. A place where I spend my time. And, too, a notebook On Living. Notes from someone who lives. . So, my garden is a notebook. Messy, but that’s how life is. . Thanks for reading, . — Max . . Longtime readers: if it looks like I’ve changed the branding on this letter, that’s because I did! I thought I wanted a separate persona for these writings, but after a few letters it began to feel forced. I’ll just be Max again. . If you didn’t notice this change, please don’t read the preceding paragraph. . And as always, I’d love it if you pause your scrolling for a second and shoot me a line. Could be what you think about this letter, or what you had for breakfast, or a long rant about something you’re really interested in. . I’m hoping that if I shout long enough into the abyss, the abyss will start shouting back. 😉 .",

            "content": "Previously, . I wrote of the way that computers farm us into “communities” to make our attention easy to harvest and sell to corporations. We don’t have a natural gradient of social interaction, fully private (alone) to fully public (in the street). Instead we are virtualized and packaged, our desires simulated by machines based on data they’ve collected. . This data is necessarily incomplete; even if you give your life fully to one megacorp, have a Brand™ phone and a Brand™ email, use Brand™ Pay and Brand™ Watch and Brand™ Messenger and Brand™ News, they can’t know everything about you. Even if you take your phone to the bathroom with you, leave it by your bed at night, let it track your pulse and your breathing and your REM sleep and your meals, it can’t know your inmost thoughts. It can’t read your dreams. The invasion of the machine sector is not yet complete. We still have a chance to define our zones. . What do you mean, zones? . I use this word a lot — too much, if you ask my girlfriend. But in permaculture design it has a specific meaning and usefulness. . In permaculture, one of the first tools we apply to any environment we design is the zones and sectors analysis. This is a map, but not just a geographical one. It’s a map of time, of energy patterns that flow through and around the landscape. . Zones divide the entire landscape into concentric rings based on how often any given area is used or visited. These rings don’t have to be perfect circles; in real life human beings don’t walk around in perfect circles. And we are talking about how often humans visit each area, not bugs or cats or robot dogs. A permaculture design is always an opinionated analysis: how can this landscape be more useful to the people who live in it? It has to be human-centric, because humans are the ones who will carry out the plan. . So the center of this wobbly bullseye is the human who lives on the land. Say we’re designing your home garden (apartment friends, you’re going to have to use your imagination). You live on, what, an eighth of an acre? Your house takes up a good chunk of that space, and you spend most of your time in your house. After all, this is where you sleep (6 hours a day), eat (2 hours), do chores (1 hour), watch TV and doomscroll and WFH (15 hours). The house, the center, is Zone 0. . Most people think of this as “indoors” and the rest of the yard as “outdoors”. Just two zones. But really, you don’t visit the entire yard evenly. Some places — like the path to the driveway — you traverse every day, but the back corner of the back yard? Maybe once in a blue moon, when the bathroom is otherwise occupied. . So Zone 1 is where you go regularly, and we’ll want to put the most energy-intensive garden stuff here. A kitchen garden, say, with salad greens and herbs you pick each night for dinner. Zone 2 you might visit once a week, so it has longer-term vegetables that need to be weeded, maybe a compost heap and a toolshed. If your space is big enough you might have a Zone 3 with some fruit trees, which you visit once a month or so. . Most city lots won’t have more than these three zones, but rural homesteads will also have a Zone 4 (pasture, woodlot) and Zone 5 (wilderness, for hunting and foraging and inspiration). Zones also don’t have to be perfectly concentric; for instance, you might have a “side yard” very close to the house that’s actually in Zone 3 by usage. It’s not meant to be a rigid hierarchy, but a way of visualizing how an area is impacted and enlivened by human energy. . . (from Deep Green Permaculture) . What about these sectors, then? . Unlike zones, which are defined from the center to the periphery, sectors are flows of energy that enter your space from outside. Sunlight, for instance, arrives from the south; at least, here in the northern hemisphere. Solar energy is crucial for gardening, but also for human activities. If you put a porch on the south side of a house, it’s going to get a lot of sunlight and stay warm longer than it would on the north side. If you put a garden on the north side, the shadow of the house will stretch across it and your winter crops will be cold and sad. . Other sectors might include a prevailing wind flowing from east to west, or a busy street nearby creating a noise sector. My parents live near a junior high school, so every afternoon students stream down the sidewalks and molest every plant they can reach. A neighbor finally cut down his apple tree after years watching his unripe harvest turn to ammunition for street warfare. We might call this the “you darn kids!” sector. . So zones are fields of activity, and sectors are flows of energy that pass through them. What I referred to earlier as the “machine sector” is the energy of computation that enters our lives from the outside. Most of us only think of physical zones as indoors/outdoors, but for our minds we don’t even make that distinction. There’s just one area, “consciousness”, and we let technologies flow through without discretion. We need mental zones. . What would mental zones look like? . I have to confess, I may not be the right person to answer this question. I’ve been guilty of using technologies in an all-or-nothing way: either I’m way offline, deep in the woods, traveling to town once a month to tell my mom I’m alive; or I’m Extremely Online: listening to a podcast, coding a project, and tweeting on three different machines at once. I only decided to segment my mental zones quite recently, after Twitter users started to have starring roles in my dreams. . I barely like to dream of people I actually know! Why should I let random Karens and Turtleneck Guys into my most personal space? . So I’ve started to zone my days. . Now, physical zones divide space by time spent. But of course I can’t segment my days by how much time I spend in each hour. Instead I have to divide time by “space” that I spend in it: how concentrated or wide-ranging does my consciousness feel at any given point in the day? . I feel the most concentrated in the mornings: my mind is sharp, my body rested, my emotions not yet triggered by the idiots of the day. This is my Zone 1 (given that my most internal space, Zone 0, is to be asleep). I have a never-ending thicket of writing and coding projects, and this is the place where I can be sure to visit them every day. . So I’ve set my phone to not allow social media apps until noon. This deflects that sector of energy until the time when my mind is wandering anyway. I can do maintenance tasks in the afternoon, and if I’m occasionally distracted by a message, nothing is lost. The chores just take longer. . In the evenings I can take in a movie or read a novel, let my mind explore the wilderness of fiction, see if I can forage any useful thoughts to chew on. And then return to sleep, alone and blessedly free of Twitterers. . Alone? What happened to “communities”? . Have you ever been to a community garden? They generally come in two flavors: rows of individual plots cultivated to the needs of individual gardeners, or an overgrown commons where nobody feels particularly responsible and things don’t get done correctly, or on time, or at all. . The exception to this rule seems to be when the Community in question actually spends time together in the garden. When people are able to communicate about their needs and skills, a truly bountiful ecosystem can grow. Let’s call these learning gardens. They tend to have good legibility: crops labeled, chores scheduled, notes kept. You can learn from these gardens, but also they learn from the people who tend them. They keep a memory and have plans for the future. And this can only happen because the community itself is the point of view: Zone 0 is not an individual, but a group of people who care enough about each other to share the work, and the harvest. . In the world of tech this approach is generally limited to developer projects. Open-source communities tend to be cultivated by people who are both users and developers of the software. They understand their own needs and how to build toward them. But most technologies are too complex for the user to also be a developer. How can we create learning software? . One model is outlined in Convocational Development, a manifesto by coder John Evans (@dr_the_evidence). He suggests that we center the software development process not around user engagement, or managerial concerns, but around a complex conversation — or convocation — between the people who make the software and the people who use it. . The fundamental difference between the convocation and traditional open source is that energy is put into facilitating discussions between users, coders, graphic designers etc. Documentation and instructions are often the weakest part of an open source project, and that excludes people who don’t have the time or ability to assemble a mental model of the open source software and its capabilities from just the code and the meagre promotional materials. The convocation starts as a basic web forum, but evolves tools and cultures that enable greater participation in the development process itself. Better accessibility, better security, better understanding of the perspectives of both developers and users. . Convocational development is open source, but it’s also open design. The features are inspired by individual users, but more importantly by the users in concert with each other, and the developers. . Instead of being algorithmically sorted into SimClusters, we could choose our convocations, and help to garden the zones we live in. Make use of the machine sector, rather than letting it invade and pollute our spaces. The first step is to talk to each other. . In that spirit, thanks for reading. . — Max . .

            "title": "Legiblate",
            "content": "In 2020 I started the course &quot;Deep Learning for Coders&quot; from fast.ai. As one of my projects, I had to train an image classifier (fine-tune a Resnet model with fastai&#39;s wrapper around PyTorch, specifically). . I wanted to use a dataset that no one had tried before, so I acquired the book cover images from the paper Judging a Book by its Cover (2017). Citing the paper here: . @misc{iwana2017judging, title={Judging a Book By its Cover}, author={Brian Kenji Iwana and Syed Tahseen Raza Rizvi and Sheraz Ahmed and Andreas Dengel and Seiichi Uchida}, year={2017}, eprint={1610.09204}, archivePrefix={arXiv}, primaryClass={cs.CV} } . The authors achieved 24.7% accuracy. As we&#39;ll see below, mine achieved 33.7% accuracy -- not amazing, but SOTA for the time. I called this book cover judger &quot;Legiblate&quot;, for unknown reasons. . I later decided to upload Legiblate to Heroku as a Streamlit app. I had to retrain a smaller resnet34 model for that, as the resnet50 version wouldn&#39;t fit on a free dynamo. That model had 32.8% accuracy and you can find the Legiblate app here. Note that if the site has not been accessed recently it will take a few seconds to load, as the free dynamo boots up. . Unfortunately for code history, I did not record the process of cleaning and collating the data into cleaned.csv. That file has 56,977 lines and associates each image with one of 30 classes. It looks like this: . name,label 1438005687.jpg,Test Preparation 0060750715.jpg,Biographies &amp; Memoirs 1580237959.jpg,Religion &amp; Spirituality 0135137829.jpg,Arts &amp; Photography 0312556411.jpg,Literature &amp; Fiction 0393339157.jpg,Engineering &amp; Transportation 0521456924.jpg,Science &amp; Math 0898699223.jpg,Christian Books &amp; Bibles 0545700272.jpg,Children&#39;s Books 1616494441.jpg,Self-Help . In the following cells I make my imports and gather the dataset. . from fastai import * from fastai.vision.all import * import ipywidgets as widgets . from pathlib import Path . data_folder = Path(&#39;/home/mage/Hacking/datasets/book-dataset/images/224x224&#39;) . imgs = get_image_files(data_folder) . imgs .

After checking that the DataBatch looks right (i.e., the images match their classes), I instantiate a learner with the pretrained resnet model, and fine-tune for 4 epochs. Fastai v2 takes care of finding the learning rate automatically, a significant improvement over v1. . learn = cnn_learner(ds, resnet50, metrics=accuracy) . learn.fine_tune(4) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 3.083939 | 2.753545 | 0.238262 | 04:15 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 2.667974 | 2.641955 | 0.268100 | 05:43 | . 1 | 2.541682 | 2.470613 | 0.308644 | 05:43 | . 2 | 2.242933 | 2.367178 | 0.331988 | 05:43 | . 3 | 1.960798 | 2.373091 | 0.337429 | 05:43 | . Training on such a large dataset took a while (5 minutes per epoch), but this was before I knew to train on a sample dataset. Luckily the loss converged pretty well at 33%. . Next I explore the predictions, to see which classes and samples are harder for the net to classify. . interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn) . interp.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(15,15)) . interp.plot_top_losses(9) . Some unfortunately predictable results here: things like &quot;The NLP Cookbook&quot;, which is a self-help book whose cover actively mimics a cookbook, or Rabbit, Run which is a novel but is represented here by some garish edition with only a basketball on the cover. . Book design doesn&#39;t have a direct relation with genre, only a conventional one. The fact that this net can guess 1 out of 3 correctly is pretty amazing. Random guessing would get you 1 out of 30, an order of magnitude different. . Finally, I save the model for future experiments, and export it to be used in production. . learn.save(&#39;legiblate-resnet50.pkl&#39;) . Path(&#39;models/legiblate-resnet50.pkl.pth&#39;) . learn.export(&#39;legiblate-resnet50.pkl&#39;) . Try the Legiblate app yourself! .",

            "title": "Where the humans end",
            "content": "Previously, . I wrote about how trees garden the forest for themselves, how humans can garden the world for ourselves, and how we shouldn’t let the computers close the canopy. Computers and humans should be friends, but that’s not how it’s gone so far. . Right now computers are cultivating human communities with the sole purpose of increasing the influence of the computers. They’re gardening us. . How are computers gardening humans? . Human life used to be centered around the village square. There were other scales of society – kings and lords, parents and children – but the village was the main operating unit. You would know most, if not all, of the people you see daily. The “public” was a physical space. You’re out in public, you see people and they see you. If you’re not in public you’re in private. The biggest transgression of this boundary was writing: you could transmit thoughts from the privacy of your room into the world at large. Or you could curl up in bed alone and read of public events from far off or long ago. . Now we connect our minds in real-time to strangers all over the world and yet we never leave our homes. . I don’t just mean the pandemic; there was a time before this plague, and there will be a time after it. In the beforetime, you could wake up in your house, drive your car to your job, go to the gym and the grocery, and come home without ever being in “public”. Every space is instrumentalized. You go here to do this and there to do that, you buy and sell, you paper-push and weight-lift. No accidental interactions. If you see someone from work at the grocery store, you ignore each other, right? Easier for everybody. . Can you think of a place that’s truly public? A place with the feel of a village square, where you don’t have to work or buy anything but can just be together with people? (These may still exist outside of America. But I’ve never left this country, and I might not make it out in my lifetime, so I’ll write what I know.) . We have parks, libraries and mass transit. That’s about it. And in all of these places we are encouraged to be quiet, keep to ourselves, leave other people alone. If a stranger approaches you in a park, do you think they’re trying to make friends? . The spaces that feel public now are the social media platforms. We see our friends, neighbors, strangers, political allies and enemies on the internet, and instead of keeping to ourselves we are encouraged to Engage. We attempt to understand others through these computer-mediated systems, but it is impossible to tell where the humans end and the computers begin. The platforms are constructed by humans, true, but they’re built to serve a very computational purpose. They connect advertisers with consumers. Every social platform, whatever their gimmick and cutesy name, is a commercial space: The Customer Store. . These platforms are built by humans, though. How do the computer’s desires come in? . Well, take Twitter for example. It’s not the most populous site – only something like 22% of Americans use it – but its effect is outrageously large because it’s where politicians and journalists and academics hang out. Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Twitter is not designed for keeping track of your meatspace friends. It simulates the public sphere: you, too, can shout obscenities at your favorite public figures! But it is still a customer store, and it has to operate efficiently. That’s where the computer takes hold. . See, there might not be that many users, but there are a lot of tweets. Roughly five hundred million tweets per day. So their goal, to recommend the right “promoted tweets” (ads) to the right “users” (potential customers), is significantly hard. Even for machines. . To succeed at recommendation, they need to optimize for computation. The machines of Twitter can’t replicate natural human relationships at this scale. They have to find a way to get good-enough results without burning a ton of compute power in the process. . To that end, they’ve built SimClusters: Community-Based Representations for Heterogeneous Recommendations at Twitter (get access). This program plots all types of content (tweets, users, “Events”, “Topics” and, of course, ads) in a high-dimensional space of “communities”. These communities are simulated clusters (hence the name) of “influencers” who have largely the same followers. . What is an influencer? . It’s a loaded term, but in this case it’s merely a mathematical distinction: there are about a billion twitter accounts, but only the top ten million are classed as influencers. The SimClusters algorithm flattens all the users into a bipartite graph, with influencers on one side and all user accounts on the other. Then it looks for high density of incoming connections. That is, it looks for groupings where a bunch of users follow the same few influencers. These people may or may not know each other, but they occupy a similar position in the social structure. . This creates a rich-club graph – an oligarchy, in political terms. The influencers are core to their communities. In the 2018 paper Conjoining uncooperative societies facilitates evolution of cooperation (PDF), which I have linked to before, it is shown that in a rich-club graph the fate of the periphery is decided by the core. It is indeed possible for separate rich-club-shaped communities to cooperate; however, the amount of cooperation is limited by the amount of oligarchs. . . Twitter has to draw a line between influencers and the rest of us. That line is arbitrary, and the size of the rich club of users is hardware-limited. The ways in which we connect to each other forms a microcosm of the modern city: if you’re an Influencer, you can warp social reality around you. The rest of us can go to one of the influencer-defined communities and do the prescribed behavior. . We are sorted into fields, like crops, so that we may be marketed to those who would buy our attention. The complexity of our interrelation is flattened to a manageable level for profit. This is computers gardening humans. It’s not sustainable, but of course it’s not; they learned from us. . .

            "title": "Accelerating succession",
            "content": "Previously, . I introduced the idea of algorithm gardening: tending software in an ecological fashion. . Computers are not all one thing, like a “cloud”, nor individual beings, as when we say “my cell phone”. Like plants, they exist in a web of interrelation. They cannot be considered separate from their connections. Neither can you and I be considered separate, as our minds are joined by this electronic message. We are all of a piece. . So we must garden algorithms. We should garden plants, as well. Build soil, grow food, encourage wildlife. But not everyone can do this. I myself have lived in a variety of apartments, hotels, tents, vehicles, and cell blocks, with limited opportunity for gardening. . Whether you’re a gardener or a programmer or not, we all have to live with plants and computers. But there is a secret that unlocks a new vision of both: ecological succession. . What is ecological succession? . It’s the natural process that turns a landscape from lifeless dirt into mature forest. . Life creates the conditions for more life to exist. There is an intelligence behind the collective movement of plants, animals, microbes and the rest. It follows the pattern we call succession. . A glacier recedes, exposing bare rock. Lichen eat the rock, live on the rock, die on the rock. Soil accrues. Grasses and, eventually, herbs and shrubs set root. The soil deepens and woody pioneers arrive, stabbing their fat taproots into the earth and loosening it to absorb more water. Then fast-growing trees move in. Their yearly loads of leaf litter accelerate the growth of the soil. Finally, the strongest trees connect their canopies and shade the forest beneath them, slowing the growth of other plants. They stabilize their environment to their own preferences. . The trees garden the forest for the trees. . . What about you and me? . As a human, I can’t eat most parts of a tree. Wood, leaves, most nuts, and many fruits are off limits. The mature forest actually offers very little food for me: the undergrowth is suppressed by the shade of the canopy, so only other shade-tolerant trees can grow. Trees are great, they provide oxygen and shade and many other benefits, but not food. I am lucky to find some berries, nuts, or mushrooms. . If you want to live in a forest, you have to hunt. And because energy is lost as it passes through each belly, you and I each need a huge amount of hunting space, which puts an upper limit on people per acre. The forest is a great place to be a tree. Not as great for a human. . The most productive ecosystem for human needs is actually the immature forest. Before the canopy closes, there can be as many as seven different layers of plants stacked vertically. Beneath the large trees are smaller trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous plants, ground-covers, and underground rhizomes. The key to ecological gardening is to accelerate succession, replacing non-food plants with food plants where possible, until the garden reaches this intermediate stage. Then simply maintain it: reap the fruits, move nutrients from one place to another, prune or remove plants as necessary. . In this system the humans garden the forest, and the forest provides for the humans who live in it. . How is a computer like a tree? . We want computers in our lives. This is evident from the sheer number of them we produce. However, it would be a bad idea to let the computers close the canopy, so to speak. If they stabilize the environment to their own preferences, they may not spare enough energy for us. . We need to maintain planetary harmony with the computers as well as the plants and animals that surround us. We are not currently doing that. The global climate is in an unstable feedback loop headed toward runaway warming, and we’re currently pushing for it to go faster. . Runaway warming would be disastrous for everybody, including computers. Computation creates heat; that’s what all those noisy computer fans are for. Computers need relatively the same climate that we do. So do plants. Our incentives are aligned, at least for now. We have to work together. . To work with the plants, we garden them. We build soil, increase organic matter, accelerate succession. The trees will take the carbon from the air and turn it into wood with their mysterious techniques. . Of course, we know how photosynthesis works, but we don’t know a better way to do what it does. Instead of re-inventing the carbon capture wheel, we should trust the plants to do what they are good at. And we should do the same with computers: create a symbiotic relationship, and share the planet. . How can we create that symbiotic relationship? . Same as we’d do with any alien species: observe and interact. Look at them. Learn about them. Try to speak to them. . To understand how we might accelerate the process of human-computer symbiosis, look at the interfaces that coders use to build their software. Coders are the people who spend the most time in computer interfaces. What metaphors do they use to converse with their digital partners — and how have they evolved? . The command line, or terminal, is the classic text-only hacker interface. It allows for a stilted one-way conversation: I tell you, the computer, what to do, and you report back to me when it’s done. I must remember all the possible commands in my head, and wait for you to finish the work before I can send another command. The command line involves a lot of attention on my part, as I have to maintain a mental model of what is happening with the mostly-invisible data, and it requires you to wait on my approval before each next step. . The script allows for a more complicated thought on my part. It’s written in a simple text editor, and it is what it sounds like: a set of directions. It might equally be called a “recipe”. I can list a series of commands, even loop them inside each other, and you (the computer) perform them exactly. I have to put together my thoughts pretty clearly, otherwise you can’t read it properly and you have to stop the whole operation and send back a record of exactly what you were doing when things went wrong. Then I rebuild the script based on my understanding of the bug (often acquired by a frantic internet search) and I send it to you to try again. . The package and its companion, the package manager, are the social form of the program. The package contains scripts written by someone else, which allow me to compose new code simply by citing the previous script. Packages can be nested inside each other, as my package depends on an “upstream” package which itself depends on five more. This stack of packages is called a dependency tree, and it is the ecosystem in which the packages thrive. . The integrated development environment (IDE) is a combination text editor and package manager. It allows me to navigate all the code in the packages I’m citing while I write my new program. It uses autocomplete to help me code quickly, keeps track of the state of the program, and reports bugs. . The notebook is the most recent innovation (though it draws from computing concepts that go back to at least the 1980s). In a notebook, I can enter code and text as equal partners, and output charts, or audio, or any type of media directly into the coding environment. I can scroll up the page and change my earlier code, then see the results in real time. This creates a two-way conversation with the computer. . Notebooks don’t yet have all the features of an IDE, but they will. For example, I’ve been using the python package nbdev, recently released by fast.ai. It allows me to build packages directly from a notebook. It does all the hard work of packaging the code, building a command line interface, and making the documentation. I think it’s revolutionary. . Using a notebook, the human does what humans do well: think creatively, intuit patterns in data, make inductive leaps. The computer does what computers do: follow instructions, calculate big numbers, transmit and display information. The interaction is symbiotic. It begins to feel like gardening. . . P.S.: For more on the development of notebooks, see the excellent nbdev: use Jupyter Notebooks for everything. . Any thoughts, write me back.

            "content": "Previously: . I wrote last week about permaculture ethics. There are other valuable things to take from permaculture, but I promise: this newsletter is about technology and the ways we interface with it. It is not a farmer’s almanac. . I just think that gardening algorithms is a better metaphor than engineering them. . . What does it mean to garden algorithms? . When you engineer something — a bridge, a car, a spaceship — you design the entire thing before you build it. But the process of programming is more gradual and experimental. You can see the general outlines of the whole, but you have to fill out each specific through trial and error. Code is not concrete. It is a language, a special way of writing in the second person: you do this, then you do that; except if other, then you do else. . Coding is communication. It’s a conversation with an alien being: the machine. . Currently, we speak to machines with the logic of capitalism. Command lines, service workers, garbage collection. Purchasing apps at the market. Executables. . But we have other ways of talking to alien beings. Gardening, for example. . Plants are so opposite us as to be aliens themselves. We move, they root. We inhale oxygen, they exhale it. They absorb solar energy. We radiate it. Plants were here long before we were, and have a totally different value system. Yet we’ve managed to get along. . Plants were doing their thing long before we showed up to organize them. They catch solar energy and atmospheric water and molecules from the soil and transmute them all into the self-sustaining process called Life. This process, this gigantic DNA-based program, is constantly maintaining the appropriate temperature and oxygen level in the atmosphere. If it weren’t, life would have ceased to exist long ago. . We’re part of this computation too. Humans are ecological engineers. Like beavers or worms, we transform the world around us, creating niches for other forms of life. We form alliances with certain plants, and those plants thrive in symbiosis with our behavior. Plants that don’t get along humans, tend not to reproduce. . We alter ecosystems everywhere we go. Lately, we’ve changed so many things, so quickly, that we’re in danger of crashing the whole system. . We were always already gardening algorithms. We’re just doing it badly. . What’s wrong with the way we’re doing algorithms now? . We’re growing the algorithms wrong, but that’s no surprise: we’re growing the plants wrong, too. Lined up like troops and fed a diet of petroleum products, the interconnected intelligence of the plant world is divided into dumb patches of monocrop. . Sure, at one point it was the best we could do. We have all these legacy technologies from the age of fossil fuels: physical machines, but also governments, markets, intellectual property, land ownership. Our current methods of farming were invented in a different time, when energy was cheap and communication was expensive. . If we started from scratch today, we would do both agriculture and computers differently. . For instance, permaculture tries to increase the number of connections between elements. The squash shades the roots of the corn, the corn grows a stalk for the bean to climb, the bean adds nitrogen to the soil for the squash and the corn. The focus is on relationships, instead of objects. . If we treated algorithms this way, we would think in terms of processes, not products. We would build rituals around the cycles of upgrades. Cultures would spring into life around different codebases. . In fact, this is happening. The open-source community is a vision of the future. The world is shifting to a new balance of power, where communication is cheap and energy is expensive. We will have to cooperate to survive; fortunately, when groups of people are interconnected, they’re more likely to cooperate. The free software available on the internet, and the millions of people who help build it, are evidence of that. . This is gardening: a community of people, sharing knowledge of a space, and the beings within it, and the way that they interrelate. . The farming mode of production is based on energy glut. It strips the ecosystem of all but the simplest variables, sucks a huge amount of fossil energy in one end, and squeezes food (and pollution) out the other. But that world is ending. In the future we have to make do with the amount of energy that hits the planet — less, in fact, since so much energy must go to the plants to sustain the climate. . No longer can we simply reduce the variables and increase the power. We have to use all the information we’re gathering to increase the connections between each person and plant — and computer. More connection means we wring more work out of each droplet of sun that hits the planet, before it floats off into space again. . In the transition to a high-information society, we will re-awaken the knowledge common to indigenous groups across the planet: Everything is connected to everything else. Life is a web of relationships. And in this awareness, we will garden our technologies. And our technologies will garden the world. . Thanks for reading. — Max . . I love writing this newsletter.

Or rather, I like the ideas behind it, and I like putting them into practice. But the name, and the subculture that goes along with it, are… awkward, at best. . You might already have an idea of “permaculture” from your own experience. Or if you’ve never heard of it before, you’re probably thinking “what an awkward (at best) word, what could it possibly mean?” In either case, I feel the need to explain. There are useful ideas hidden within the permaculture wrapper. . What is permaculture? . Permaculture grows out of the organic gardening movement in the 1970s. The founders are some white guys from Australia, who study food growing techniques from all over the world. They want to synthesize all these different methods from different environments into a scientific system that could be used anywhere. They can see that modern agriculture is damaging the earth: polluting the water, stripping the soil, burning irreplaceable fossil fuels and filling the sky with greenhouse gases. So they describe a design system for permanent agriculture, or permaculture: a way of planning, building, and maintaining food production systems that work with, instead of against, nature. . What happened to it? Well, the original guys start teaching a Permaculture Design Course, It takes two weeks and gives you a piece of paper at the end that says you’re Certified to do Permaculture Design. Then they encourage other people to teach their own courses (although these days, due to degree inflation, you have to take a five-day Teacher Training as well). So unlike architecture, for instance, there’s no authority on who or what “permaculture” is. . As you can imagine, permaculture methods are not as profitable as modern agriculture methods. This is because agriculture dumps its problems on the rest of the world. Pollution, miserable wages and working conditions, and the climate emergency are all “externalities” that unsustainable agriculture doesn’t have to pay for. . So it’s easier to make a profit by selling the word “permaculture,” than by growing food in a sustainable way. And our world is built on profit. This quickly becomes a pyramid scheme, where I am a permaculture teacher and you pay me to teach you how to get paid to teach permaculture. Or would that make me a permaculture teacher teacher? Anyway, it’s a feedback loop, and not one of the good ones. . Now there’s all kinds of people teaching permaculture: grifters, hucksters, and shills; preppers, astrologers, and youtubers, on top of the core demographic: self-important white dudes with big hats. . Most of these people don’t actually think at a systems-design level. They usually remember one weird trick, like “contoured terraces” or “earth building”, and specialize by teaching classes on that trick (and teaching classes on how to teach classes). I suspect that the general conception of permaculture is more “cool techniques” than “overarching philosophy”. . What do we need from it? . Permaculture is a technology, and like any technology it has at its core a set of values. Unlike most of the technologies we use today, those values are explicit. They’re the three permaculture ethics: care for earth, care for people, and share the surplus. The last one is often the hardest. Most people can think of a natural environment they love, or a person they would do anything for. Sharing the surplus is harder to imagine. . We live in an era of intense greed. That is the unspoken value system behind the technologies that run the world: individual liberty, private property, corporate fiefdom. The alienation of the individual from the community is a mistake made by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Their hypothesis (and it is a hypothesis) that human nature is to be a single person making rational choices in your own best interest, is falsified by the evidence. . We know now that we’re part of an ecological web. The land and the seas and the atmosphere are tranformed and maintained by all the organisms on the planet. We are not separate from animals or plants. We need them to live, and at this point, they need us too. . Most people don’t act like they live in the ecological web, though. We act like they live in a world of rational actors, even when our own behavior disproves that view. . And why not? The greed machine is everywhere, and everyone else is acting like it’s real too. Every piece of land in the world is Owned by someone, and they need to make a profit from it, because if they don’t, someone else will. Profit is greed in number form. . The technologies we interface with every day — social media and artificial intelligence, sure, but also newspapers, TVs, factories, megastores, automobiles, freeways, air conditioning, tractors and farms — are all built on this foundation of greed. This in turn changes the way we relate to the world. . The law of the instrument says if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. My corollary: if all you have is a profit motive, everything looks like it’s not nailed down. . If we built our societies and infrastructure on the permaculture ethics, instead of on personal gain, what kind of world could we live in? . We can get a hint from the world of free and open-source software. The biggest shifts in technology over my lifetime have germinated from projects like Linux and Wikipedia: massive collaborative efforts that generate shared wealth for everyone involved. This is surplus sharing in action, and it’s already changed the world. . Digital technologies move faster than infrastructure or cultural changes. The interface where technology shapes culture, is also the interface where culture shapes technology. This feedback loop means that any little change might be magnified hugely. The interface is a crucial leverage point. What values should it carry? . Thanks for reading, — Max . . P.S.: I hope you’re enjoying Augmented Intelligence.

            "content": "Hello! This is the first issue of Augmented Intelligence, a newsletter about friendly computing. . I’m Max. I’m a whole-systems designer living in high desert New Mexico. In recent years I co-founded a bookstore and taught myself to code, but before that I was a builder of permaculture gardens. . The whole-systems philosophy of permaculture guides my approach to design. Whether I’m designing a business plan, a website or a food forest, I use ecological thinking to create productive, beautiful and resilient systems. . But this newsletter is not an advertisement for my services (I’m plenty busy — who isn’t?). This newsletter is about interfaces. Specifically, the interface between humans and computers. . There are other interfaces, of course, wherever two domains touch. A garden is an interface between human and plant. A bookstore is an interface to the world of written thought. . Just because an interface works, however, does not mean that it fits well into the larger system. The dominant style of human-computer interface design is short-sighted and wasteful. Through the lens of whole-systems design, it looks like a system for making the maximum amount of human misery, at the greatest cost. . To understand why things are this way requires a grand vision for politics, economics, history and science, which I do not have. . What I do have is an obsessive interest in interface design, and your email address. Expect a weekly missive on the hows of interfaces: . How did these interfaces evolve, how do they work, and how can we make them better? . The name of this newsletter is a play on “intelligence augmentation,” a computing concept coined in 1962 by Douglas Engelbart: . By “augmenting human intellect” we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. . — Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework, Engelbert 1962 . Though gaining in popularity, this vision is still not realized. We build fake people — “artificial intelligences” — and force them to be our “assistants”, when we could be building tools that augment human intelligence. Humans could work with, not against, the machine. And the machines could work with us. A cybernetic meadow, where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony. . Thanks for reading, — Max . . P.S.: If you got this in your inbox, you’re one of my very first subscribers — a true friend. You might know more about any of this than I do, or you might have an outside perspective that I fail to see. . Write back whatever thoughts you have, even a quick sentence or a weird question. I’m learning in public here, and I’d like nothing more than to help and be helped. . One favor?

            "content": "It’s been a while since I wrote this letter. . That’s for a lot of reasons, some of which are listed below. I’m in a liminal place in my life and I need to unfuck my head for a while. I’m sure I’ll regain the confidence to try to explain the whole world. Sooner or later. . In the meantime, I’m working on a new letter. It’s called Augmented Intelligence , and it’s about a much smaller subject: interfaces. If you like SCIOPS, you’ll probably like this. You can find it at robotface.substack.com . . It’s in response to a challenge by an internet acquaintance. I’m highly responsive to peer pressure, so it’ll probably even come out weekly! . If you’re curious what happened to SCIOPS, I wrote some thoughts about it on Twitter. Reprinted here for posterity(ish): . I have functionally stopped writing my newsletter, though I have not told anyone that it is over . why is this? because podcasting is easier than writing? because covid apocalypse makes apocalypse newsletter obsolete? because I’m not confident enough in my worldview to share anymore? . I’ve begin to kind of hate newsletters, perhaps. I get a lot of them, was tipped off early to Republic of Newsletters. there are too many, now, and the vibe has changed . One long-time writer, has turned his formerly-interesting letter into an occasional screed blasting everyone who’s not as woke. . He’s not wrong, even. Just… angry, and long-winded, and self-righteous. . I’m afraid SCIOPS has gone the same way. I don’t want to be that guy . When I started writing it, I wanted to be an expert. It’s hilarious, looking back, because the style was so unsophisticated. This is why “Medium posts” are so cheesy: they’re the enthusiastic raving of the neophyte. . I wanted to be Your Guide to the Cyberpunk Apocalypse. How absurd: can you imagine how annoying that person would be? The guy who keeps pointing out “that’s an advertisement, see, they control your mind through the pattern of lights and sounds, they’re targeting you by your data” . then for a while I was trying to keep up with the News Cycle. trying to ride the cryptocurrency wave the right way (take the money and the good ideas and run) instead of getting caught in the tulip bubble. it worked for me, although not in a big enough way to last 🙄 . finally it settled into a monologue, bouncing between sermon and comedy, following my erratic mood. . I felt a pattern emerge: 1000 words is enough to give an introduction to a topic, but not enough to dive deep. yet how can I expect someone to read an email longer than that? . I don’t have the mad-dog vigor of the investigative journalist. I don’t have the STS degree or the SV friends to demand academic respect for my thoughts. I’m just another internet weirdo trying to make sense of the world. . basically a street maniac with End of Days sign . I don’t want to be an expert, actually. I don’t want to be a preacher. I barely want to be a writer – such a limited bandwidth medium! (he said, on Twitter) . I do have a useful worldview. I want to share it. but it works because I’m still learning. “a foolish consistency”… . I think the topical nature of the “newsletter” is the culprit. . “a newsletter? what’s it about?” . substack exacerbated this by commoditizing the newsletter. the decision to subscribe was based no longer on “who are you?” but “what does your product do for me?” . on Twitter you follow . people , not topics. the topics arise from the interaction of the people. . not that I’m a huge fan of Discourse. but it’s certainly more rewarding than writing an essay, putting a stamp on it, then dropping it into a sinkhole and waiting for a response . more immediately rewarding, anyway. obviously a heap of essays is more satisfying to look back on than a bunch of replies and threads and snarky QTs . alternative explanations abound, though. . Twitter has me locked in a dopamine loop, maybe, and I can’t get long form thoughts together without the instant boost of hitting “send” on each paragraph . maybe it’s just because I have a steady, healthy relationship with someone who will listen to me rant and joke and sermonize all day. . a conspiracy to stop my writing, orchestrated by Big GF . or . the topic of SCIOPS (namely, psyops) is now actually the content of psyops produced by actual PSYOPS teams. infectious conspiracy brain is a tool of the conspiracies of control, to make it seem as if they’re more powerful than they are, and to muddy the waters on other ops . a conspiracy against me, manufactured by Big Conspiracy . conspiracy-industrial complex . because SCIOPS is about dark wizards fucking with your mind, and because so many minds are infected with different exotoxic memes, I end up having to talk vaguely about the mental atmosphere, rather than digging into specific brainworms . and because SCIOPS is “about something”, i have refrained from writhing the things that it’s not about. like the last two years I spent founding a bookstore in my hometown. or the bizarre code experiments I cook up on the weekends. I should have been documenting those . Thank you, all, for reading all these years. I’ll be back. . Max .",

            "title": "SCIOPS 04.14: Mental Map",
            "content": "Picture the Earth from space. You’ve seen it in movies and pictures. The Blue Dot, the Universal logo, the Google Map. You can hold it in your mind, rotate it, observe the poles and the seas and the familiar shapes of the continents. Can you see the clouds? The fingerprint whorls of tropical storms, the long Pollack streaks of the jet stream? . Now predict the weather for the next three days. Look at your mental map of the planet and tell me the forecast. You can’t, right? Your mental simulation doesn’t have up-to-date weather data! . Of course it doesn’t. The biggest computers can only keep track of so many data points, and each of those is updated at a different rate. Even the proverbial government spy satellite, the one that can see every hair on your ass while you shit in your neighbor’s yard at night, is sending a series of pictures. If those pictures are coming at a rate of 12 per second or more, a human looking at them will see motion. But that’s a simulation too. . Each mind is a world-simulator. Nobody has the full picture. You are a brain in a jar, viewing the world through the peripherals of your senses and your cell phone and your social milieu: satellite feeds that can never capture the most cutting-edge data. Every one of us is ultimately alone. We’re together in that. . Maybe this seems basic to you. Cogito, ergo sum , right? A demon could be controlling what you see and hear, but who cares? If it’s a perfect simulation, then it doesn’t make a difference. If it’s not, and you can figure out what’s true and what’s illusion, then do that. That’s what science is for. . Science is great, don’t get me wrong. There is a material reality, which we can all measure and agree on. It is self-consistent, even if we don’t understand all its rules yet. From the atomic level to the galactic, you can test your theory and adjust your expectations. As above, so below. . This was the triumph of the hermeticists, the wizards and alchemists that fomented the Enlightenment. The world is a predictable place, and you can manipulate it to your will, if you know its ways. . But like all great power, this came with a curse. As above and below, so in the middle. Macrocosm, microcosm, mesocosm. Humans ourselves are part of the universe, subject to its laws. We can’t defy gravity; we can only trick the air into lifting our wings. In the same way, we can’t become perfect rational actors simply by thinking “therefore, I am”. . Our brains evolved to hunt ruminants in the prairie. They weren’t programmed in one all-nighter by some cosmic whiz kid. They accrued, over millions of years, in a series of hacks and kludges. There are multiple layers of software and operating system and interface. Crucially, there are hacks. . Psychology wasn’t even a thing until the 19th century, you know that? We had philosophy, mesmerism, phrenology and psychoanalysis; all variety of metaphysics and religion. But experimental psychology –the application of the scientific method to the original instrument of science, the brain itself – started in the 1800s and didn’t really take off til the 20th century. . Of course wasn’t long before we found exploits in the evolved mechanisms of the brain. People aren’t perfect; they can be tricked. The low magics have always been about this. But combined with the iterative power of experiment, psychologists began to hone in on specific knobs and levers of the mental apparatus. . If you can scientifically control someone’s brain, why, you could make them do anything! Propaganda was born. . In 2020 we each drift lonely in a sea of propaganda. Neural nets can hallucinate fake news and fake images at a rate unimaginable to the spin doctors of yore. Algorithms sort endless amounts of content and drivel into piles and shove them into your feed in mysterious proportions. You never know who else has seen the same memes you have, the same trends, the same news stories. All conversations are prefaced with an epistemic dance, where each party gauges the other’s reality bubble through opaque references and nonverbal cues. Can’t be caught talking to the out-group; they are infected with brainworms, and should you gaze into the abyss behind their eyes you may never escape. . At least, that’s what they want us to think. The most powerful nation-states in the world are all operating campaigns of division and deceit. Narrative warfare, they call it. Control the enemy’s story and you control his mind; control his mind and you win the war. . The narrative that everyone on the Other Team is evil and mindless and depraved is an easy one to spread, especially as our other social institutions wither due to quarantine. Nobody’s going outside. We see each other only online. We’re all afraid of getting killed (by disease, by lack of money or food or medicine, by cop or militia or mercenary) and we’re afraid none of our leaders are actually in control of anything (they aren’t). . How nice it would be to blame all of this on those dirty Outgroupers, whose minds are filled with lies and who would happily watch you die if it furthers their goals. So good to know that your reality is the true one and theirs irrational, false. A very convenient truth. . What do you think the weather will be like this week? .

            "title": "SCIOPS 04.13: Cool Zone",
            "content": "America has erupted in flames, in shooting and gassing and death. Our cold civil war has reached a tipping point. It was inevitable, because the prosperity of this country was built on the backs of black people, and the bloodthirsty supremacist state will not stop killing them. . And with 30% unemployment, and a pandemic, and a tyrannical government that took this opportunity to pillage yet more wealth from the people of this country and give it to their corporate masters, tensions are too high for a recuperation. A positive feedback loop has begun, an eruption of rage and desire that is mirrored in cities around the country and around the world. We have entered what historians call The Cool Zone : . “a period in history that’s super cool to read about, but much less cool to live through.” . The one thing a government is supposed to be good at is protecting those who it considers citizens. But in the last three months we’ve seen who America considers citizens: corporations, billionaires, police, and politicians. They got us all to hide in our homes, for the very real reason of pandemic, but they couldn’t resist looting the world while no one could stop them. Now they’re telling us to return to work, and if you step out of line, the boys in blue will kneel on your neck. . I’ve been saying that America is a police state since I was fifteen years old. This has made me popular at family gatherings, I assure you. (The trick is to sit at the kids’ table. Kids have not yet developed complex self-bullshitting mechanisms like the rest of us.) But now everyone can see it. The police are on a rampage across the country, attacking anyone who questions their unimpeded killing power. Now the mask is off. . The mayors and governors and police chiefs don’t care about you. At best, they see you as a follower; at worst, a nuisance. An individual, indistinguishable Voter, a member of the Public who can have an Opinion, a Citizen of the Battlespace who is Subject to the Rule of Law. . Our rulers are not all evil, though none are free from its stain. They’re just human. Their little monkey brains can’t give a shit about every single person they’re responsible for. Too many people jostle for their attention, too many billionaires and lobbyists, too many algorithms and demographics and data points. No one person can understand it. So they do what humans have always done in times of chaos: simplify the world to Us and Them, and plan the complete defeat of Them. . In the coming weeks, a lot of megaphones will be shouting division from on high. The elite already know their plan, who’s in-group and who’s out. They want to confuse the rest of us. Let us fight each other. They would like a civil war just fine, as long as they remain safe in their bunkers, as long as they control the satellites and nukes and strategic AI. . They don’t think they need us, after all. The rate of automation will increase and they can operate the world by robots. Send robots to Mars, upload their brains into robots while the rest of us fight and kill each other in a plague-ridden desert battleworld. . We hear that there are “outside agitators” causing protests in every city around the country. Where are these agitators coming from? Did they all swap cities? Are they from Space? From Hell? How do they pass among us? . Meanwhile the cops are dropping off pallets of bricks near protest. They’re smashing up their own cars, shooting at people with “less lethal” weapons, turning a blind eye to lynchings. Agitating, instigating, attacking. All to make the common people of this country afraid of each other. . How desperate must the masters be, to gaslight us so brazenly? This hand-wringing narrative, “violent accelerationists disguised among peaceful protestors”, this is a mind trap, to make us mistrust each other. In psychological warfare this is called FUD: Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. We must strengthen our resolve against it. . We know who the real instigators are: the police, the military, the white supremacist gun clubs. The occupying force, swaggering around our cities with guns, patrolling us in armored vehicles and helicopters. The inevitable has occurred: the Forever War has come to “liberate” the United States. Those who would shelter in bunkers and green zones see the cops as their bodyguards, and the rest of us as agitators from the Outside. . What does this mean for the future? The summer will be hot and the people unemployed: there will be more protests, there will be more riots. The pandemic will not end – in fact there will be another surge in hospitalizations and deaths in June and July, from the states that have unlocked their economies and from the protests alike. . The food supply will be shaky over the next year, and next year’s growing season will make or break a lot of people’s lives. The storms and the heat this summer will be bad, made worse everywhere that infrastructure begins to fail. . All of this was already locked in by the pandemic and the corrupt, backhanded or incompetent responses at all levels. Now many more variables have come into play. The federal government may double down on the fascism attempt to strong-arm an election, or fall apart into a failed state and a military coup. The surveillance companies and fulfillment megacorps have to walk a tightrope of allegiance to the USA while being ready to bail any minute into global markets. We may watch the White House live on Twitter. . It’s okay. America was already in a bad way. Admitting it doesn’t make it worse. It helps you prepare for the next steps. . There are at least two crossroads right now. One is the climate collapse, of which the virus is a symptom. How we deal with that is hard but known: we stop using fossil fuels, stop building new concrete buildings everywhere, and reforest the earth. Will we do it, has been the question, and the answer so far has been a solid No. We have ten years left to change course. . The other is the problem of inequality. Inequality in civil rights, in the enforcement of those rights, in the distribution of wealth and income and power and prestige. Black people have known this longer than anyone, and those of us who were raised to think we’re the “middle class” need to listen to their experience, because we’re all in the same boat now. The rich own everything, they own the machines and the software and the politicians and the laws and the police and the guns and the many many bullets that our society has been hell-bent on producing for the last hundred years. The rest of us, the Outside Agitators? All we have is each other. . Whether or not we manage to fix the climate, or just mitigate and survive its collapse, is intricately entwined with the struggle for equality. If we let the richest among us, the people who have had to do the most cruel and unjust things to maintain their power, who have been the furthest from consequence and accountability, if these people decide what to do with our planet for any longer they will kill us all. Rather, they will let us die, ignore our screams, as they live out their dreams in a world of pure imagination. . We must not be divided. We must look at every other person and see a talking ape, just like us. Each of us is wounded, every day, by the deliberate decisions of smooth-faced men at a distance. We must see ourselves, and others, as people with the capacity to change. We must look beyond superficial distractions, feel a duty to help each other. This is how we will survive, in the end, either way. . But if we can wrest the steering wheel from the adrenachrome grip of the idiot-kings, we might have a chance to actually turn this thing around. We could live in re-greened cities, sun-dappled forests overrunning concrete ruins, where food is plentiful, where you work at fixing the earth twenty hours a week and spend the rest of your time crafting, building, playing, eating, conversing. A decent place, a good place, a new place. Not America. A place less grandiose, and less aggressive. An example to the world, finally, of what freedom and equality could mean. . This isn’t a superhero movie. It doesn’t start with you knowing everything and having a plan and end with you saving the day. It starts with you waking up again not dead, listening to the song of birds or the rattle of helicopters, and thinking about the world you want to live in, the world you want to hand over to the millions of children who are just finding out, wide-eyed with shock, what kind of world they were born into. . It starts with you asking your neighbors, your friends, family: are you okay? How can I help? . It starts with you speaking up, when you need help, when you feel isolated and misunderstood. We are all feeling it, this dark lightning that tears apart the world of illusion and reveals the secret war that was here all along. We are collectively awakening, collectively grieving, collectively shedding our false identities. . The human individual has been breached. Our minds are connected in a global web of instant communication. And as we know now, our bodies are connected too. We will all experience ego death as we come to terms with this. We are in a planetary liminal space. . Whatever makes it out of the twenty-first century will not be the kind of human that came into it.

            "title": "SCIOPS 04.12: No Normal",
            "content": "It’s two months into the quarantine here, and people are ready to get Back To Normal. I hear them shouting to each other in the parks, standing six feet from each other but all petting the same dogs: “THIS IS SO CRA-ZEE! HAHAHAHAHAHA I KNOW RIGHT? CAN’T WAIT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL!” Or I talk to people on the phone for work, and they say “When this is all over, when we get back to normal, such and such can go back to the way it was and then everything will work like it’s supposed to and we can get back to business as usual. Hope you’re well.” . But I don’t want things to go back to normal. Of course, I’m an outlier, because I already spent all my time at home and talked to no one. Some would say, just because I love being On Line, doesn’t mean everyone should have to live like me. A lot of people liked normal. Still I say, normal should not return. . Normal wasn’t as good as you might think. Certainly there were good parts, in the life of a decadent citizen of a falling empire. HBO and swimming pool and food delivery: there were amenities. But the daily dose of soma was only made possible through the subjugation of billions of people. There were always “essential workers”, they never had health insurance or decent wages, and they were already dying from the toxic, stressful lives they live. . If normal is bars and restaurants and jobs and vacations and car trips and business flights and video game tournaments and music festivals and Bitcoin mining and war – constant, endless war, war for the sake of advancing war science, war that benefits no one but the merchants of war and their sycophants – if normal is wasting the precious energy of our only planet in a blind and drunken rage, why would anyone want to go back to normal? . Normal was only possible through a collective hallucination. The post-war world was a fantasy conjured by the most traumatized and globally connected generation in history. They smiled and had liquour for lunch and did whatever seemed to make sense, and that’s a perfectly fine reaction to the events of the first half of the twentieth century. But since then everyone’s been trying to maintain that exact status quo, that normal . House, car, garage, two and a half kids, a chicken in every pot and a TV in every room. . The neoliberal regimes installed in the eighties changed the underlying economic system, but left normal intact. They took care not to alter the mythos of American hegemony, of Disney and Ford and Coca-Cola. Normal was a coat of cherry-red paint on a Predator drone. . Even if normal was good to you, that’s no reason to want it back. Normal wasn’t going to last. For one thing, global capitalism inherently creates the conditions for pandemic. People flying all over the world to shake hands, and the factory farms that feed them, and the constant hunt for new resources in the most wild places: it’s the perfect environment for a virus to jump to humans. I mean, for the last ten years we built our economy around “going viral”. What did we expect? . Normal was never going to last. We were already hurtling toward catastrophe, with no steering wheel and no brakes. We still are. . All currently living trees are projected to die within 30 years. The climate is going to change so much, so fast, that they won’t be able to survive in the places they live. And they can’t just pick up and move. . But humans can, and will. Millions, possibly billions, will migrate toward the poles as the earth warms. Resources will become scarce, cultures will clash, nations will dissolve. All of this was ordained before the virus ever stirred. . Normal was a hallucination. We are living through the greatest disaster humanity has ever known. This plague is not some side quest, a mini-game to be played out so that we can return to the main storyline. It is a harbinger of the doom that is to come. It is the herald of Apocalypse. Those who heed it, will define the way we live in the future. . I don’t mean the “new normal”. Mistrust anyone who says “new normal”: they’re selling something. The future has no normal. The future is weird everywhere. . Thanks for reading, . — Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a letter that arrives on an unpredictable but non-random schedule.

            "title": "SCIOPS 04.11: Intelligence Transfer",
            "content": "Idiocracy is a myth. Not only is it not real, it’s not realistic. . I mean, obviously the movie Idiocracy (2006) is not realistic. It’s an over-the-top satire. I’m not concerned with plot holes or continuity errors here. In fact I’m not really concerned with the movie itself. It’s very “of its time”, and I’m happy to leave it there. . What concerns me is the setup of the film: “smart people” are wise enough to use birth control and have one or two babies each. “Dumb people”, lacking foresight, have many more children. Over time, the dumb outbreed the smart, and the world is led to ruin by the inane decisions of President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho and his ilk. . This is the theory of dysgenics , and it carries all the baggage of its counterpart eugenics . In this worldview, modern society has removed the evolutionary pressures that made humanity such an intelligent, resourceful species. Now that we let the “idiots” survive, and breed, the thought goes, we will sink back down to the level of apes. If this were true, it follows that we need superior intellects to control the breeding of humanity, to get us back on the evolution highway. . But, of course, it’s not. Evolution is real, but dysgenics is not. I didn’t think this argument needed making, but unfortunately I came across a dark sector of Twitter where people still buy into this shit. Look at this meme — content warning, reactionary trash: . . Yeah, you read that right: “genetic elite”. It’s disturbing to me that people think this way, but the burning dumpster that is our world right now confirms that it’s not just internet trolls. Last weekend, astroturfed protests across the country demanded that the government let everyone go back to work. . . “Sacrifice the weak / Re-open TN”. Unapologetic social Darwinism. . The irony would be funny if it weren’t so sad. The same people who are skewered by the Idiocracy movie, the ignorant hillbillies and internet neckbeards, are the ones calling for a cull of the human species. They think that they’re on the same side as the billionaires, that they’re all making America great together. They don’t realize that, to the rulers of the world, they’re expendable dupes. . What makes humans intelligent is not only in our heads. We don’t even have a singular metric for “intelligence”. IQ has been debunked , and from its very beginning was promoted by eugenicists, to the point of actually sterilizing over 64,000 of the “feeble-minded” and the poor. That’s in the USA, by the way. Nazi Germany looked to California to model their eugenics program. . What makes us intelligent is in between your head and mine. Sociality, language, communication and coordination. Intelligence means nothing in a vacuum. (In space, no one can hear you think.) . To be fair, the CHUDs who think we’re losing our “genetic elite” are probably not getting laid at all. Remember, when people on the internet have an opinion about something, it has more to do with their own psychological hangups than it does with reality. . Sure, some parts of intelligence are genetic. The part of your brain that keeps track of what time of day it is, when to sleep and when to wake and when to take a morning shit, is so ancient that we can find the same structure in the brains of fruit flies. Even plants have circadian rhythms. When my cat wakes me up at six in the morning with her incessant mewling, that’s intelligence. She has a circadian rhythm too, she needs that morning shit, she knows that she can make me wake up and let her out. . Cats don’t meow at each other, they communicate through body language. They only meow at us. They have learned that we respond to this screaming-baby sound and they can use it to express their needs. In turn, we have learned that cats are assholes and will not let us sleep in, and that a hurled pillow will never reach its target. . How often would a cat, in the wild, have to dodge a thrown object? They have learned that too. . It’s not that smart and dumb people don’t exist. I’ve lived in the world, I’ve worked in agriculture and construction and retail. There are some incredibly dumb people out there. Including, no doubt, the people pictured above. But that intelligence (or lack thereof) isn’t built in. It’s learned; it’s transferred . . If having babies were the only way to reproduce your intelligence, the churches of the world would focus more on reproduction than they do on evangelism. Memeplexes would pass along familial lines: “my father was a dumbfuck, and his father before him was a dumbfuck, and his father before him…” . No one would bother to educate or persuade people outside their relations. We would be dynastic explorers of the realm of possible intelligences, speciating into different humanoids as our paths of inherited knowledge diverged. We would become dwarves and elves and orcs, separate races with distinct destinies. . In fact, this is the underlying neurosis of eugenic thought. This is why IQ correlates with race: because the tests were invented by racists. The narrative of different races has been obliterated by the decoding of the genome, but the social Darwinists carry on with their bad science because they’re not concerned with reality. They’re concerned with justifying their own bigotry. . Even before modern genetics, it was easy to see that intelligence could be transferred. That’s what tools are, after all: solidified intelligence. The hammer contains within it a knowledge of nails. Transferring that intelligence is as easy as handing over the hammer. Memes, and their physical instantiations, are intelligence that moves horizontally, between individuals in a generation, not vertically down a bloodline. . And we can share our memes with non-human beings too. The plants carry knowledge of photosynthesis and nutrient accumulation and cloning. We can map that intelligence in our minds and commune with them. We can guide the plants in their growth, and they in turn will guide us. We can teach the cats how to awaken us, and they in turn will teach us to rise with the sun. . In reading this letter, you have replicated my thought patterns in your brain. If you respond, I will learn your thoughts. The intelligence of our species grows far faster than evolution. How else would we have made it this far? .

            "title": "SCIOPS 04.10: Essential Work",
            "content": "They tell me it’s a luxury to stay home, and I understand. The people who are still at work, the “Essentials”: they’re risking their health, their lives, the lives of their families. Those of us in house arrest are supposed to be grateful to the Essentials, laud them as heroes along with firefighters and cops and the National Guard in the streets. . Grocery clerks and truck drivers and delivery workers are great, don’t get me wrong. They should get paid more than the cops, for sure. And obviously healthcare workers are actually on the front lines, fighting the invisible invaders and doing triage on the survivors. . But I’m not grateful to be cooped up. Even though I have a sunny apartment and a beautiful girlfriend to spend my days with, I’m losing my sanity. And I’m sure I’m not alone. . It’s not just worry. Of course I’m worried about my small family bookstore, and whether we will ever open again. I’m worried about my parents: they’ve been telling me for years that they’re Old now, but it hadn’t really hit me until now. I’m worried about food supplies in this high desert city. We can’t control the behavior of meat-packers in South Dakota or fruit pickers in California, but we rely on them. We can’t grow enough food to support everyone in this city, unless we rip up every lawn and gravel patio and replace them with tres hermanas right now. . So I’m worried, and I’m trapped in my house, but that’s nothing new. I’ve been worried for ages about the visibly fragile global economy and ecology. The apocalypse has been unrolling for a while now; but like an avalanche, it starts out slow and silent, near-invisible. I’ve hidden in my home for the last few years, it feels like. Every time I tried to go out and have fun, I was stunned and disgusted by all the blind consumerism – and by the complacency in everyone’s eyes. I felt like the kid who saw the Emperor buck naked. I was driven either out to the wild or inside and online, away from the mass hallucination of “society”. . The problem for me, during the “normal” times and even more so now: I want to help, but I don’t know what to do. I have many powers and capabilities, but I am still only one person. I want to spend my energy where it’s most useful. I want to know that I’m helping people and not wasting my time. . Maybe you feel this way too. You get used to one way of being useful, one way of creating meaning in life. Then, with the existential question of “Who am I” bandaged by a societal role, you can survive the daily confrontation with the hungry world. You can say, “I played my part,” even if that part was tedious, or humiliating, or cruel. Then you can relax. . There’s something insulting in being told you’re not essential. Not just that: you’re detrimental. You’re not allowed to leave your home, because you’re just a risk. You have nothing to offer the real world. You stay in your room and play with your Lite Brite. . Of course, the math doesn’t square up. A lot of Essentials are making minimum wage and don’t have health insurance. In a very real sense, they’re risking their lives, but their wage says expendable, not essential. Nurses and doctors are being called out of retirement to go into the pandemic wards, knowing they have a one in twelve chance of ending up a patient. . Meanwhile, the House of Representatives are out of session “absent an emergency,” and the billionaires are safely locked up in yachts. The poor are dying three times as fast as the rich. Tenants are expected to pay rent whether or not they still have a job, even as many places suspend mortgage payments for landlords. . We’ve entered the exterminist stage: the powerful have stockpiled resources and extracted themselves to green zones, governments have used the crisis to strengthen control over citizens, and financiers have made money off the bailouts and the market volatility. Now the ruling class feels safe, they’re going to wait out the virus and let the poor die. . Those who still believe in liberal democracy are going to have a hard time accepting the reveal: society was a prison all along. We used to be allowed to work and shop and consume; now we’re not. Now we have to stay inside. Maybe if we’re good we’ll get our privileges back, but if a few people break the rules, we’re all going to suffer. . The problem isn’t that we have a virus. A scientifically minded, ecologically balanced society could deal with any virus that came upon us. It’s the manic energy of capitalism, the unhinged positive feedback loop of exploration and extraction and extortion, that is the problem. . Remember, we were already in an apocalypse before the virus. Climate collapse has very similar qualities to pandemic: it’s world-wide, it’s complex and scientific, it doesn’t respond to bluster or bravery and it won’t back down. Worse, it happens on the scale of lifetimes, so no one feels personally threatened by it. Or personally responsible. . Pandemic is a wake-up call, and a premonition: in the clear waters, the smog-free skies, the return of wildlife, we see the better world we have to build. We have to stop driving cars everywhere, we have to stop shipping trainloads and truckloads of plastic trash across the world. We have to figure out how to stop using plastic, or recycle it entirely. We have to find ways to bring meaning to our days without the frenzied high of commerce. We have to re-orient our values: away from the complete liberty of the idealized individual, toward the interconnected responsibility of all life for each other. . I don’t want to sink into sheltered complacency, hiding in my home, letting the Essentials suffer for me. I don’t want to be a piece of wetware in a global computer, locked in a box, rewriting the same fake-helpful email updates as the governor announces each new month of “temporary emergency measures”. I want to help. If all I have is a vision and a way to communicate, that’s a start. . Nobody knows what to do. Even the rich and powerful are merely scrambling to staunch their losses and cover their crimes. The new ways of life will emerge from the edges, not from the center. These were already the challenges we faced, and we were already strong enough to meet them. We just need to admit that the time has come. . Normal is not coming back. You don’t want that, anyway, do you? Isn’t there a better world, one you ordinarily wouldn’t let yourself imagine? . Allow yourself to imagine it. That’s essential work, right now. .

            "content": "Now is a great time to become extremely online, if you weren’t already. . It’s the beginning of April. Third week of mandatory telecommuting. I am sheltering in place with my partner. We are not allowed to go to our jobs, but we may not stop working. The economy must churn. . “Businesses must cease all in-person operations,” says the governor, so we must eject ourselves from our personalities and continue the infernal operations. . We sit at a small table heaped with computers and coffee cups and headphones and USB cables. Glowing screens peer out from the tangle, and we gaze back with hunter’s eyes, stalking the scuttling cursor. Our bodies are static but our hands twist into conjuror’s configurations on our clackiest keyboards. We glance at each other, absentmindedly, occasionally. The cat slinks through this electronic jungle on her way to the windowsill. She doesn’t know why we’re home all the time. She is annoyed. . The economy slouches on. We’ve brought the office home in the most extreme of ways. And the school, and the gym, and of course we had already brought home the movie theaters. The internet sputters along as everyone in the neighborhood tries to video chat or download music or stream entertainment for their children — but it does flow. We are all online at once. This has never happened before. . As someone who has been extremely online for thousands of years, I want to tell you: you’re not ready. You merely adopted the internet; I was born in it. . No, that sounds so cocky. Really, I’m the one who’s not ready. The last time that millions of extroverts logged on at once, we got Web 2.0. I’m still reeling from that shift; the internet I knew was one of anonymous faceless voices in pure text. The invasion of photos, videos, shares and likes and followers was too much for me, and I retreated for a while into dark nets and off-grid communities. I came back and learned to put up with smartphones and Instagram in exchange for the joys of deep learning and Twitter. . In the last few weeks, videochat has been normalized. People who would never have used it before, especially business and schools, have come eagerly online. Everyone is learning to accept each other’s pajamas and unwashed faces. Even me, a hater of all visual content. I videochatted like four times last week. . The transformation we will see in the coming year will be bigger yet. . I can’t predict what’s coming; there are too many variables. And no one else can either! It’s important to remember that, while we watch the leaders of the last world scramble for purchase on the stirring giant of history. . The central banks are spewing money from a firehose. The workers are unemployed and uninsured. The ruling class are snatching their bags and hightailing it for the exit. Hospital ships and quarantine camps oh my, and there’s another record hurricane season coming, everybody get ready to shelter in place, don’t make any trouble. There’s too much all at once. Anyone who says they know what will happen is definitively overconfident. . The forces of control will always claim to have be in control. The bigger your platform, the harder it is to realize when it’s already begun to fall. No one is going to tell us that the rules are off, that the master is gone. We have to decide that for ourselves. . How do we know? In a world where the facades are peeling away, what structures can we trust? Not the newspapers, not the government, not the apps, not the banks. What social unit is the right size for making sense of the 21st century, when conspiracy theories and disaster movies come true? . Podcasts. I don’t know what the future will look like, but the present is podcast-shaped. . The podcast is the molecule of the internet. . You should make a podcast right now. You can do it from your smartphone, although a laptop and a USB mic would be better. It doesn’t matter if it sounds great. It doesn’t matter if anyone listens to it. . The point of a podcast is to have a virtual community in which you can make sense of things. Whatever things you need to. We’re all absorbing huge amounts of information every day, along with the coffee and the booze and the home-cooked ramen. You need a place to, well, output that information, once you’ve digested it. . You get should get a friend who will meet up weekly for a couple hours on videochat. You can pod alone, but it’s harder, as you have to have a conversation with yourself. Good news is, all your friends are home and bored right now. They’ve never been more likely to record a podcast with you. . And your podcast can be about anything: true crime, local politics, space communism, TV shows. It doesn’t matter what it’s about, as long as you’re juiced. There are probably other podcasts about the same thing — that’s great! They’re juiced too. Listen to them, find them on social media. Now your podcast is in the context of other podcasts. . People who are also juiced about the Thing find your podcast, and join your podcast chat. There you talk with your co-hosts and your listeners and your fellow podcasters and together you can create a world. It doesn’t have to be big. It’s a world that makes sense, a world that matches your lived experience. And that is power. . In this chaotic environment, things are messy and unpredictable, but they’re not impossible to understand. A worldview is a weapon. .

            "content": "Hi! Nice to see you. How you doing? . Seriously: how are you doing? Real question. I’d like to know if you’re contagious before we get within spitting distance. . How am I? How am I ? How are YOU, buddy? HOW ARE YOU— . Anyway. Nice apocalypse, isn’t it? Viral isolation is the perfect disaster for the 21st century: it gives you a month to stock up on groceries, and to avoid it, you have to stay inside and binge TV. But then it sneaks up and kills the people you love. . I’ve been on mandatory social distancing for a week now. It felt like summer break at first: don’t have to go to work, no invitations or appointments. Lots of time to read and code and catch up on shows. . But the landlord still wants the rent check. The groceries are unaffordable or unavailable, and you have to cook them myself now because you can’t trust the drive-through. You can’t trust anyone, in fact, and you can’t touch them, and you can’t go anywhere people are. Before, there was no public space that wasn’t commercial. Now there’s just no public space. Even the libraries are closed. . Of course, we were already isolated and malnourished in front of the TV. This is just the austerity machine going mask-off. This is the prelude to Armageddon. Our sense of separation was humanity’s hamartia , our tragic flaw; now we are trapped in the consequences, pressed forward to our inevitable catharsis. . . The deaths are only getting started, here in the USA. The official plan is to delay the apocalypse; we’re going to stretch it out over such a long time that it becomes the new normal. We can all live alone in our homes indefinitely, as long as we don’t have a riot, coup, drone strike, nuclear war, supply chain collapse, market crash, depression, famine, or a bigger better virus. . Things will never go back to the way they were. We talk about the time when we “return to normal”, but normal is like sea level. It changes. . Maybe events will slow down again, in the new era. The first few months of this decade have had plenty of excitement. We might find a new stability, for a while, but it will be a changed world. . Perhaps we’ll be galvanized by this trauma, to form a health-based economy, where all the people of the world toil to find cures to every disease, so none of our citizens should involuntarily die. . Or go the other direction, become a teenage psycho plague colony, a horde of walking bioweapons, untouchable but unstoppable. This appeared to be Britain’s plan only last week. I wonder why they changed their minds? It worked well for them in the past. . Maybe we’ll adjust to being extremely online, and form a cellular hivemind where we communicate entirely in tweets and tiktoks. Spend our time cultivating dance crazes and meme formats. Become viral. Learn to fear the outside, with its invisible dangers. Turn our cities into moon bases and the world into a lifeless desert. Reverse terraforming — we’ve done a pretty good job of it so far. . We have to consider the future again, here at the end of the end of history. . . My city is slowly shutting down. The streets are empty except for the occasional dog-walker or cyclist. The stores and restaurants wait breathlessly for each new restriction of operations. Nobody knows what to expect. There are too many variables: elections, oil prices, acts of war, disinformation, insider trading, borders closing in. Over it all the virus hangs, a bleak and ominous cloud, close enough to see but too distant to measure. . When big changes are coming and you don’t even know what to prepare for, it’s easy to spin out and lose your mind. It’s important to find your footing and survey the terrain. It’s good to have tools of futuring. . For instance, I have laid out a few 2x2s for my friends and family lately. Basic futurist praxis: take a choice you have to make, and a problem you don’t have control over, and lay the options on a Cartesian grid. Each quadrant represents a possible reality. Consider the details of each world, consider its likelihood, but most of all consider how you would feel about living in it. . I was going to write about this last week, but attention is precious right now and it felt too much like bullshit. Like corporate doublespeak. . Fortunately, a Quantitative Futurist wrote a Medium post on The Startup (a publication by GrowthSupply.com) : “How Futurists Cope with Uncertainty,” by Amy Webb . If you’ve never seen scenario planning before, it’s a good introduction. But you don’t have to read it right now. . Viewing scenarios from this individualist angle is fine; it’s especially comforting when the greater society seems to have its head up its ass. But individual action won’t save us from global threats. . Our companies and non-profits and nation-states are going to take advantage of this emergency to declare themselves our saviors and thus our rightful rulers. But ultimately these are abstractions, and we don’t have to answer to them. The choices that will make a difference will happen at the level of individual people. People who choose to work together, who choose to see beyond these artificial divisions; to see our people and our planet as one connected organism. . Isolation might protect us, but cooperation is what will save us. . We are about to undergo a singularity of our already singularly social species. Everyone in the world will be touched by this in some way, at the same time. We will be connected telepathically while distributed physically, slowing our use of energy and focusing our collective efforts on defying death. This is the year when we realize the power of the planetary mind, or die trying. . And since our future will be decided collectively, we all have a chance to help craft it. Any little choice, in this liminal time, could ripple out through all of time. Know what future you want to live in, and you might actually create it. . . Expand the horizons of your future with the Unhinged Acceleration Assemblage Compasses , as collected here by Jay Springett @thejaymo. . These memes are the dark shadow of the 2x2. They refactor the values of the political compass for the new dangers in the waters ahead. Many of them are scary, or reprehensible. This is also the case for reality. . The ur-meme is this, from Gregory Marks @thewastedworld: . . . I don’t even know what all those words mean, but I’m glad I put them in my brain. One thing we can be sure of: the land of Business As Usual has sunk into the sea. We must choose a heading, because the storm is closing in. .

            "content": "19:57:19 . It&#39;s the binge-watch apocalypse, but a lot of people are probably limited to the one or two streaming services they can afford. I think it&#39;s time for some tips on that most ancient and mysterious of arts: I N T E R N E T P I R A C Y 🗨️ 1 ♺ 2 🤍 4 . . 19:58:02 . Caveat: don&#39;t do this if it offends your moral sensibilities. Like if you wouldn&#39;t download a car? Don&#39;t do internet piracy. Also, if you could download a car, how cool would that be 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 3 . . 20:00:55 . Other caveat: if you already know this stuff, cool! If you know stuff I don&#39;t, please share! But a lot of people don&#39;t, including people who follow you, and people who count on you to do the piracy. Give a person a fish, they eat for a day. Teach them to download a fish, 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 20:09:06 . The second trick, and the easiest thing that anyone can learn, is: internet search &quot;THING I WANT TO WATCH watch free online&quot; 🗨️ 1 ♺ 1 🤍 1 . . 20:12:18 . The first page of results will be a bunch of things like &quot;watch tv free 2019&quot; and &quot;1 2 3 watch video dot net&quot; and &quot;streaming solar video dot russia&quot;. These are good. Sift through, you should see at least one that plays a real video. Click a button like &quot;server 2&quot; if you see one 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:34:34 . The &quot;watch free online&quot; sites just aggregate videos that people have uploaded elsewhere. There&#39;s no risk in using these, at least legally. The risk is to the hosting site, so sometimes they have to take down the videos. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll see different &quot;server&quot; options. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:36:01 . The next best place to find things, especially movies and music that are new or popular, is torrents. You might be scared of torrents, because the industry wants you to be. It&#39;s easier to instill fear than it is to actually track and cite people for sharing. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:38:58 . Not that they don&#39;t track! They do. Especially for very new movies and shows, the industry watches popular torrents and sends notices to your ISP. I&#39;ve had like seven notices at the place I currently live. The last one was as long as my arm 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:40:38 . The thing is, notices don&#39;t really.. *do* much. The ISP interrupts your usual browsing with a stern message, asks that you admit to being 18, and click a button that says &quot;I won&#39;t do this again.&quot; That&#39;s all. It escalates if you keep getting busted, but not very much. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:42:46 . One time I had so many notices that they made me call the ISP and talk to a real, live person. That person said &quot;What I need you to do, is say to me, you won&#39;t do any pirating. Then I can turn it back on.&quot; I said &quot;I won&#39;t do any pirating!&quot; and like that -- we&#39;re back. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:44:16 . Besides, it&#39;s easy to avoid being busted. You just don&#39;t upload. They only bother people who are uploading. Morally, is this good? To leech and not to share anything in return? I don&#39;t know, whatever, we&#39;re pirates, who cares 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 20:48:42 . So the simple way to torrent is this: get a torrent client called Transmission. There are other clients, but this is the one I know. It is not full of spyware. Other clients might be. Do your own research, but also, just get Transmission. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . . 20:50:39 . Then internet search &quot;the pirate bay&quot; and go to the top link. It shifts domain names pretty often but this should get you to a torrent searching site. And because you got uBlock Origin, you&#39;re not immediately bombarded with sketchy porn ads. Type &quot;THING I WANT&quot; in the search box 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:52:08 . Find the version of the thing you want -- 720p or 1080p is a big criteria, but basically you want the one that&#39;s in your language (ENG for me) and has the most Seeders and Leechers. Those are people sharing the whole file or part of it, and they are going to send the file toyou 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:53:52 . You can click the little magnet icon to make Transmission open right away. Torrents are the easiest way to get popular stuff, because the more people share it, the faster it downloads. You still have to wait for it to download, but it&#39;s the old standby for a reason 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:56:35 . There are other services for more esoteric things. There&#39;s Soulseek, for instance, a program that is definitely centralized and for some reason hasn&#39;t been hit with a lawsuit for like twenty years. It&#39;s great for obscure music and ebooks, but I wouldn&#39;t get TOO illegal there 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 20:58:26 . Or take mobilism dot org, where I&#39;ve seen many ebooks and android apps. Like many bulletin-board warez sites, it wants a login. Don&#39;t make an account. Just go to https://t.co/6HDLfHk2Tl and find one someone already made, and sign in using those credentials 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 21:00:13 . Of course, in the age of chatrooms it&#39;s often about WHO you know. Many Discord servers and FB groups are full of people who would happily send you a file. One Discord I recently saw had shared a Google Drive full of movies from all eras, with instructions on how to download them 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 21:07:03 . If you really love the part of Netflix where you scroll through seven million little pictures before watching some hollywood explosion movie after all, well, there&#39;s always Popcorn Time: https://t.co/ltjfiyMvn3 works just like streaming. NB IT WILL PROBS GET YOU BUSTED. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 21:08:07 . With Popcorn Time you can&#39;t turn Uploads to 0.0Kbps, like you can in Transmission. If you can&#39;t turn off uploads, you can&#39;t avoid getting busted. But like I said earlier, that&#39;s often like a 4 second problem where you just click &quot;sure boss&quot; and it goes away. 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 21:09:46 . If you&#39;re worried about supporting your favorite artists or directors or something, SEND THEM SOME MONEY. Or buy some merch or whatever. You know Spotify and Amazon ain&#39;t sending them shit, right? Like point zero zero zero zero zero zero fuckall 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 0 . . 21:11:07 . IN CONCLUSION: You should download a car, it&#39;s free, it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone and you probably won&#39;t get busted. Plus if you do, well, you&#39;ve got a getaway vehicle. Godspeed, you filthy buccaneers! 🗨️ 0 ♺ 0 🤍 1 . . 21:30:44 . should I whip up a Joe Biden deepfake yet? or nah 🗨️ 1 ♺ 0 🤍 2 . .",

The knock-on effects are impossible to predict, but here&#39;s a guess: the market crash reveals the fact that no real value has been created since 2008.

            "content": "Society is stupid as hell. . Not, like, the concept of society. I might be a misanthrope, but I don’t denounce society as a whole. I mean the specific society, the one I live in, and in all likelihood the one you live in as well. This dumbass society has metastasized across the planet. (Caveat: if you do live in a non-stupid society, please email me, I need to escape.) . Example: the landlord cut down the trees at my place. This is the new owner; she hasn’t evicted me yet, but yesterday she evicted the elms. . These were good-sized trees. Their branches shaded my second-floor window, constantly in sight but silent, like the world’s chillest roommates. They kept out the brutal desert sun and gave me a little cover from prying eyes. Now they’re gone, and I’ve got a wide-open view of the car lot and the convenience store. And in turn, they have a view of me. . This is an example of stupidity. Not the people involved: the guy who actually cut the trees was smart enough. At least, he dropped them skillfully into the narrow path between the building and the fence. He also had the smarts to call the landlord and put her on speakerphone when I barrelled down the stairs to yell at him. “Just doing my job,” he said apologetically, sharpening his saw. . The landlord, too: not aggressively stupid. She thinks the root systems of the trees will damage her investment. She’s working with the one piece of data she has: the value of the house. If the trees bust up the foundation, the house will be worth less. That’s as far as she can see. . That’s why society is so dumb. Each human has so much intelligence: the landlord knows about real estate markets, the landscaper knows about saw blades, and I know about all the things I do in this building that shouldn’t be visible from the street. But that intelligence is trapped in our heads. Society coordinates our behavior through the filthy lens of price alone. . This is the “general intellect,” (a phrase used once by Marx and then discarded): the collective knowledge of humanity, as instantiated in our tools and rituals and languages. The house, the saw, the fence are all thoughts made real. They are more than just the labor of the people that built them, though they are that as well. These artifacts are crystallized knowledge. . The concepts of price and property and employment are key pieces of this intellect. These are software libraries, loaded by our human bodies and enacted to the digit. The general intellect of society perpetuates itself through these interacting parts: the trees will affect the price of the house, the price will affect the owner, the owner hires the landscaper to remove the trees. Nowhere in this interaction does the society ask what I think, much less how the elms might feel. . We didn’t build this. The house and the property laws were both already here when I was born. We are each individually smart, but the society makes us dumb. It reduces everything to one signal, the price. . Price is a measurement of how much of something there is, versus how many people want it, right? Markets are a decentralized way of allocating scarce resources. At least, they’re supposed to be. But there are so many things unmeasured, and so many other metrics by which we could allocate things. The feeling that the trees gave me, the temperature difference they made in the apartment, the carbon they were drawing from the air: none of these things are calculated by the pricing machine. Only the amount of houses and the amount of saws and the amount of mouths to feed are counted. We’re trapped in the self-fulfilling logic of general stupidity. . This isn’t the only way to live. For fifty thousand years humanity did without capitalism, without the reduction of all things to exchange-value. We certainly had some other bad ideas in that time, but it proves that we can organize a society differently. If I had lived in a pre-capitalist society, someone still might have cut down the trees. But not to “protect their investment”. . And while this society is relatively new, it is also five hundred years old. The combined knowledge of humanity has advanced. Each one of us carries an external brain that gives us access to the biggest library ever imagined, that performs the functions of a hundred machines, that lets us think and work and organize in real time with other humans around the globe. Every human now is as powerful as all the humans of the 16th century combined. Or we could be, if we weren’t hindered by society’s obsession with price-finding. . Our general intellect is genius-level, but our general executive function is terrible. It’s like our society is drunk, or concussed. Or undeveloped, child-like. . That’s a hopeful way to look at it, I suppose: maybe as a species we’re teenage, unruly, taking stupid risks and refusing to live up to our potential. Maybe we’ll grow up just in time. . Or maybe we’re just a collective dumbass and we’re going to skateboard off a cliff. Who knows. .

            "content": "There’s a philosopher called Gilles Deleuze, a French guy from the mid-20th century. He wrote a book, with partner Felix Guattari, called A Thousand Plateaus . I like this book. I can’t actually explain the ideas in it, but I like it. It’s dense and insightful and rewardingly weird. . So when I ran across a twitter bot that retweets any mention of Deleuze ( @diffandrep ), I thought it would help me find some other weirdos to talk about this obscure book with. . I certainly found some weirdos. Deleuze is the spooky figure at the crossroads of all bizarre ideologies. I should have known, I suppose: I’m using his arcane ideas to build a ramshackle ideology with which to escape the slow apocalypse. Of course the other guys are too. . Escape from the apocalypse is like hopping off a train while it’s moving. You want to go any direction except forward along the track. If you stay too close, you get run over. You have to make a vector away from the train while burning off your momentum. And there are obstacles to avoid. . It turns out that you can use Deleuzean theory to justify or conceptualize anything: anarchism, state power, transhumanism, posthumanism, accelerationism, hypercapitalism, far-right narratives, antifa tactics, becoming an alien monster, summoning alien monsters to earth, certain types of people actually being alien monsters already. Or you might just be a philosophy nerd, tweeting about your studies with your college friends. . One thing Deleuze and Guattari write about is the difference between arborescence and rhizome between the branching, hierarchical tree and the zig-zagging, omnidirectional root plant. Think ginger, or strawberries: no top or bottom, no trunk, just nodes reaching out and planting more nodes. My twitter feed usually works more like a tree: I follow x people, each of them follows y people. It’s technically a little more complicated, but to the user it’s the same: for a thought to get in my feed, it has to come down some branch of the follow tree. I have somehow signed up to see it, and there is some way for me to hide it or unfollow that poster. . This bot slices through the follow-tree like a kitchen knife through broccoli. It connects all the branches and all the spaces in between the branches. It flattens the twitterverse across one feverish, obsessive dimension. The bot is rhizomatic. It connects me to that alien species, “Not followed by anyone you’re following”. . Of course there’s another way that I see strangers in my feed: Promoted Content™. The CEO of T-Mobile has been pestering me for weeks to follow him. The Wall Street Journal has moved on from telling me I’m depressed; now it’s showing stills from American Psycho and shaming me for not having an expensive watch. The Deleuze-bot and the ad market both deterritorialize my follow tree. . I met people through the bot, people who I followed because of their Deleuzeposting. Now they’re my internet friends: we share memes, signal-boost each other’s posts, harass the same grifters. Every day my feed gets more Deleuzean. I share things that the bot shows me, and my content gets more Deleuzean too. This is a feedback loop. The bot retweets me more often. I am becoming-bot. The bot is becoming-Max. . Inevitably, capital tries to recuperate the routes of escape. There are intellectual settlers here, who abuse the keywords for free promotion. They hitch their wagons to the bot’s train, to sell their blogs and t-shirts and shit ideas. Even if they’ve never read Deleuze, the grifters must chase clout where they find it. In this way the philosophies of escape are captured by the need to make a living. Thoughtspace is colonized and the self-declared thought leaders demand fealty. . After seeing enough of these posts, I realized that the signaling mechanism was the problem. The @diffandrep account retweets anyone who says the word “Deleuze”, whether they are talking about philosophy or not. So I built a different bot: @deterrnement . . I used natural language processing software to extract the key phrases from A Thousand Plateaus unusual words, neologisms and repeated multi-word phrases. Words like arborescence, deterritorialize, nomadology , “ body without organs “ and “ machinic assemblage “. The bot searches for all these terms every nine minutes, timestamping its finds so that it doesn’t waste time searching through old tweets, and it shares them. It’s a machinic assemblage that deterritorializes the timeline. . It forms a line of flight from promoted content. . It accelerates the process of shitposting. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 04.05: Cancel Cult",
            "content": "I watched the State of the Union address last night. The American president announced how great everything is, and summoned a dozen human props to prove it. People clapped, not all of them. It was boring as hell. . Fortunately I watched it with my friend simulator. I never go into these political things ungirded. I watch pirated streams on Twitch, where my favorite pundits and comedians yell insults at the government in real time. Mystery Politics Theater 3000. This is not much different from CNN commentary, except that the talking heads have the correct opinions. Of course, I would think that, because I choose which opinion overlay to experience. . The biggest surprise about this speech was its seriousness. This president has positioned himself as the class clown, the speak-truth-to-power everyman. If that sounds absurd to you, you’re not his audience. He won the office by saying the uncomfortable things that a lot of Americans secretly believe and doubling down on every controversy. The sedated statesman bragging about his successes made for terrible TV by comparison. . Everyone’s a comedian now. The journalists and pundits and politicians all compete for your belief, and the quickest way to make it seem like people agree with you is to make them laugh. Social proof: if other people find it funny, what am I not getting? . We’ve been trained to the rhythm of the laugh track: setup, punchline, audience reaction. “News”, “takes”, “likes”, reinforcing each other in a feedback loop. We must produce opinions for the content mills, and we must consume opinions as raw material for our opinions. The opinion economy must grow. The marketplace of ideas demands consumer choice. . This is where the idea of “cancel culture” formed. If your takes aren’t hot enough, or your jokes are too edgy, you’ll be boycotted by the content consumers. You will be de-platformed, your comedy license revoked. No more irony or snark. No more opinions. The audience have left the building. You have been priced by the marketplace of ideas, and your value set at zero dollars. . Only that’s not how it works, is it? The book that was just canceled is at the top of the bestseller lists. The comedians that were canceled are selling out tours with names like Sorry If I Stepped On Your Itty Bitty Feelings , U Mad Bro? , and Stop Hitting Yourself!. The president has never been more popular than during his impeachment. . Boycotts in the marketplace of ideas are as effective as boycotts in, well, the marketplace. Nobody has to appeal to the mass market anymore; in the era of targeted advertising, you pick your niche and stick with it. You commit to the bit. The people who live in the same reality-stream will stay loyal to you when you’re under fire. In fact they will double down, in a classic sunk-cost fallacy. Negative reviews from your enemies read like positive blurbs to your fans. . The marketplace of ideas is debunked, anyway. Human beings aren’t rational actors maximizing expected utility. We’re hive apes. Our minds are malleable, our realities are socially constructed. Laughter and outrage short-circuit the rationality system and aim straight for the brainstem. It’s easy to be reactive, opinionated, hotheaded. And it’s addictive; that’s why it’s encouraged by broadcast and social media alike. After all, they don’t sell the ideas. They sell your attention. . The real money is in the marketplace of eyeballs. The ideas are a loss leader. . To use an ecological, not economic, metaphor: ideas are plants, and we garden them individually and collectively. If there’s a big walnut tree in your backyard, its natural toxins will kill anything that grows nearby. Its seeds will scatter around the neighborhood, attempting to wipe out existing plants. I have an interest in what happens with “your” tree. . Perhaps that doesn’t take it far enough. We are each a forest. Inside of you are two trees, and they’re sharing resources through a mycorrhizal network such that their surface appearance of individuality belies their true interconnectedness. The communal fungal networks twining within me see the communal fungal networks twining within you. We are the landscape upon which memes evolve. . You can become exo-toxic, like the juglone-poisoned soil under the walnut. You can let a part of your soul grow so competitive that it will not allow another kind of thought to sprout. But look at the Other Team: don’t you wish they were less closed-minded? Don’t they wish that about you? . When next you get caught up in some viral opinion, notice how feverish you feel. Did you read the book, watch the speech? Are you replicating an opinion overlay? Whose tweets are you recycling for your own off-the-cuff remarks? . Remember: you don’t have to have an opinion about anything. Things happen. You can regard them, you can observe patterns, you can compare those patterns to the things you are told and you can see if they are different. You don’t have to agree with anyone. You don’t have to even know about most things that people have an opinion on. Just act totally surprised that you missed it, and nobody will notice the difference. They’re just trying their opinions on you, anyway, to see if you laugh or cringe or get hot. You’re not the audience, you’re the focus group. . The memes don’t care about you. They just want to convince you that they rule everything. But in reality, most people’s days are defined by waking up, getting that bread, and sedating ourselves back to sleep. All the ideologies competing for your mind are equally misleading, because they all deny the material conditions of being a human animal in a collapsing ecological bubble on a rocky planet flying through the void. . It’s important to keep that in mind. Especially this week, when propaganda is flying thick and fast. You’re a person, on a rock, in space. Neither your ideas, nor the ideas you oppose, are in charge. All the systems of control are falling apart. We’ve never been at greater risk for existential disaster, but we’ve also never had such great opportunity. If we can see each other as equally malleable, as parts of a greater whole, we can labor together to make the best possible future for life on earth. But we mustn’t be controlled by the ideologies that we claim, or claim us. . And that’s my official opinion on all that, trademark copyright dot com et cetera. Don’t @ me. .

            "content": "There is no real world anymore. . Rather, there is no difference between online and off, the real and the cyber. The borders of meatspace have dissolved in the caustic soup of bots, memes and cognitive hacks we call “the Discourse.” . ICYMI this week: The richest billionaire got hacked by a different billionaire, who sent him threatening memes and stole his dick pics. Allegedly. . Jeff Bezos, a.k.a. Short Lex Luthor, opened a video file sent to him by Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia. That file contained an exploit that allowed the Saudis to exfiltrate data from Bezos’ phone, according to the report published by Motherboard . The prince later sent him a meme featuring a woman who resembled Bezos’s mistress, Lauren Sanchez. At the time their relationship was not public. It’s possible that this is how the National Enquirer acquired the compromising selfies with which they tried to blackmail Bezos in 2019. . Opinions differ on whether the hack was connected to the extortion campaign. Which failed anyway, as Bezos called their bluff (in a post called “ No thank you, Mr. Pecker ,” which incidentally is how any normal person would respond to a dick pic from Jeff Bezos). . Some security experts have questioned whether the forensic report is even accurate. Regardless, billionaires texting each other viruses on encrypted messenger is absolute cyberpunk gold. The 2020s were a long time coming, but they certainly made an entrance. . I don’t have any billionaires in my contacts. But I do bridge different communities: tech criticism, transhumanists, anticapitalist shitposters and general Weirdos. At least, that’s what I found from analyzing my friends-of-friends network: . . This little fishy is a map of the accounts I follow on twitter as @deepfates . Most people, myself included, start a Twitter account and immediately follow anyone that seems the slightest bit interesting. This leads to a firehose of bullshit that makes the site unusable. Now I try to only follow the people whose posts I truly enjoy. I use lists and alt accounts to follow people who I only want to see at certain times. . Don’t squint: you don’t have to read the map to make sense of it. . Each dot is a Twitter account, each line is a connection between accounts (following, followed by, or mutually following). Accounts are positioned by the amount of connections between them, creating a social topology. This is a 2-dimensional physicalization of a high-dimensional space: each person may be said to be closer or farther from each other person in the graph.The algorithm that lays them out (ForceAtlas2) simulates attraction and repulsion until the nodes find equilibrium. . The colors represent sub-communities, whose members are more closely connected to each other than to other parts of the graph. This is called the “modularity.” I don’t totally understand it, I just learned how to do this last week (from this thread by @MenanderSoter ). . The dots are sized by “in-degree”: how many people on the map follow them. People with high in-degree are considered to be “authorities,” whereas people with a high out-degree are “hubs”. Because this is a graph of the people I like to follow, that means authorities are highly respected by the people I respect, and hubs respect a lot of the same people I respect. The biggest authority in the graph is William Gibson, which makes sense. . This is the same map, but with nodes sized by out-degree: . . The out-degree map shows which accounts are hubs of my corner of the Twitterverse, who synthesize information from many sectors. Indeed, if m1k3y or enkiv2 or arikia link to something, I’m likely to read (or have already read) it. We pay attention to similar things, though we reside in different places. . And the big green dot? That’s my alt account, @cat_upgrades . I follow a lot of the same people with both accounts, but the alt is not quite centered on the graph. It’s off in the green community, which consists of leftist shitposters (close to the main blob) and pure comedy accounts (the blob off to the right). This is an interesting group, because the comedy accounts don’t interact with any of the other communities and form a sub-clique attached only to other comedians. The rationalist/insight-porn community, in yellow, is, similarly smeared but has a more even distribution. . The red and blue communities are tightly linked. The blue one contains more people who I think of as “journalists” and the red more “sci-fi writers,” although there’s a lot of overlap between the two jobs these days. Blue also seems to have a lot of NYC-based people. Real-world proximity bleeding back into the digital space. . Because there is no real world anymore. My internet friends live in a different world from my neighbors, and the intersection of those worlds makes a holographic reality just for me. We shape our online selves, and in turn they shape our lives. . There was an interesting read at Ribbonfarm this week: Being Your Selves: Identity R&amp;D on alt Twitter, by Aaron Z. Lewis . It’s long, but boils down to: having just one identity online sucks, because you get trapped in playing the part of Firstname Lastname rather than exploring different sides of yourself in different contexts. This is true, but shortsighted. . The self is multiplicity. It’s not a singular soul dancing through life in a series of masks. The self only exists as interaction. There is no person behind the mask. The self is a seething mass of urges and moods that change and are changed by the world and time. . The self is a community of its own. . It’s cool to have alts, but that doesn’t mean that you have a main. All online identities are already alts, and in-person identities are as well. The person you are in front of your mom, or your mistress, or the crown prince of Saudi Arabia: all different. Different but not separate. You morph. Your way of speaking, mannerisms, even your priorities will change based on the environment. . And the environment will change you back. And your desire will change the environment again, in a feedback loop. Be careful who your friends are. If you’re going to text with billionaires, do it on a burner phone. .

            "content": "You know Twitter slips ads into your feed now? Or “Promoted Tweets”, I guess. Like it wasn’t enough that they broke the brain of every journalist and politician in the world, they also have to make money off it. . Lately they’ve been serving me an ad for the Wall Street Journal. The ad has one of those flat millennial illustrations, of a guy picking at his food with chopsticks. And it says this: “You’re feeling depressed. What have you been eating?” . The link goes to an article titled “The Food That Helps Battle Depression.” I don’t know what the article says, because the Wall Street Journal has a paywall. And in case you couldn’t guess, there is a zero percent chance that I will buy a subscription. . For one thing, I’m thirty. I don’t need a newspaper. I don’t want to wake up in the morning, go outside in my slippers, then sit around puffing my pipe while I catch up on yesterday’s stock prices. I want to down a gallon of coffee and mainline notifications until my brain is mush and I’m late for work. . For another thing, I’m not rich. The average reader of the Wall Street Journal makes $242,000 a year. That’s twenty thousand a month. I once made three thousand dollars in a month, and I felt like a king. . That was not this month. . So even if I did want to read the Wall Street Journal, I can’t afford to. Yet there it is, this ad, every day: “You’re feeling depressed. What have you been eating?” . Okay, so I haven’t seen a vegetable in like a week. But I have a good reason: I haven’t left my house in a week! I often see vegetables when I leave my house. There’s… grass, right? Grass is a vegetable. . My cat eats it. . And there’s those tall broccolis that grow in the parks. Big fuckers: fifteen, twenty feet high? Those have got to be good for you. . Besides, I’m not depressed because of my diet. I’m depressed because I spend ten hours a day staring at my hand, just scrolling. I’m like a train riding on a single rail. . Sometimes I switch over to my mentions, but that’s no better. It’s like the trolley problem in reverse: do you want to have your brain wrecked by the bad takes of random idiots, or by the same five reply guys who explain your jokes back to you? . I’m not depressed because of my diet. I’m depressed because the planet is on fire and five guys have like all the money and everyone I know is busy maintaining their internet brand and their side hustles and their private snaps, frantically self-promoting so that they can get the most internet points before the Chuck E Cheese closes and they have to cash them all out for disappointing prizes such as “clean drinking water” or “the last gallon of gasoline in town.” Because once the money is worthless, the only thing left is clout. . I mean, I’m not depressed. Who said I was depressed? . Oh, right, Twitter. Twitter decided I was depressed, using a complicated algorithm that measures the amount of hours I spend on Twitter, the time of day I use it, my (frankly depressing) number of likes and followers, the shape of my skull, the distance between my eyes, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and a hundred other factors. . They have a huge spreadsheet where each user’s numbers are stored, and they train a neural net on it. They cover one box in the spreadsheet and say, “Given all these other numbers, what number should be in the box?” And they do that a hundred million times and now they can predict how depressed I am! Or how horny, how outraged, how drunk, how broke, how lonely. I’m stripped naked before the eyes of God, my sins automatically confessed and my penitence prescribed. . Forgive me, Jack, I am depressed. This is what I have been eating. . Then the Twitter rep goes to the Wall Street Journal guy and says “Hey, we figured out how to tell if people are depressed” and the Journal guy does finger guns and says “Hell yeah, give me that!” And they go to an extended lunch at an overpriced sushi place and if there is any justice in the universe they get food poisoning and die. . But the gears are already in motion, and the conveyor belt of content slides this ad into my hand. For all I know – for all the Journal ad guy knows – it’s just going to everyone’s feed. Oh, you’re on Twitter? You’re feeling depressed. Not really the sort of insight that requires artificial intelligence. . There’s no other way this ad could have ended up in my feed. I couldn’t be a worse target, right? I’m never going to sign up for the Wall Street Journal. I would rather see Wall Street burn to the ground, as long as the janitors and bartenders make it out alive. . After all, the stock market goes down if the minimum wage goes up. Stock prices are a measurement of human suffering. The finance bros keep track of how much happiness they have extracted from our lives, and they make bets on whether that will go up or down, and then they make bets on those bets. That’s the economy. . In that sense, this ad is more of an insult than anything. If their average reader makes as much in a year as I make in a decade, they don’t need my money. They’re just bragging. “You’re feeling depressed. Loser.” . I’m depressed? You’re depressed! This whole society is depressed! What have I been eating? I’ve been eating Twitter, because I can’t afford ramen. Fuck off out of my feed! . Not you, dear reader. Get in my mentions. Follow me @deepfates for tech stuff, @cat_upgrades for podcasts and shitposting. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about “targeting”.

            "content": "Good evening, ladies and otherwise. Happy apocalypse, and welcome to the Twenties! Enough with the doom and gloom, let’s get some martinis and go dancing. What’s that you say, the world is on fire? Great, because I’ll be wearing this flapper dress for the next ten years and I hate when my thighs get cold. . This is the decade that’s going to make or break our planet, true – but don’t be disheartened. It’s important to remember that the apocalypse goes both ways. We have more power than we’ve ever had, for good and bad. We could wreck the entire world (and it certainly looks like we’re trying). But we could also build utopia. If we’re to overthrow centuries of oppression and extraction and injustice, there’s no better time than right now. We have the technology. . I often write to you about the negative sides of technology, the scary and stupid things that mundane people do when granted godlike powers. But tech is neither good nor bad nor neutral . The rulers have their world surveillance and behavior control machines. But the street finds its own uses. . Was my last letter too dark for you? Here comes the optimism: the only way to survive on this planet is to overhaul the way we think about property, and production, and power. We have the models for this. We just have to implement them. . The idea of property, that one person can be responsible and in control of some aspect of reality, is hubris. All things are connected, in an ecological web. DNA itself is copied and remixed everywhere, all the time. Our patents and plats and painted lines are a parody of the complex processes that produce the natural world. . The future peers through in hip-hop, internet memes, podcasts, open source software. Sampling and forking and screenshotting are all 21C modes of interaction. The scum on top of the pond is where the new life grows. . In time we will accept that the rational individual was a myth. We are all part of a flow of nutrients and genetic goop. We need to grow up and act like it. . I’ve been thinking about this in the context of podcasting. Yes, I’m on a podcast. I hate to self-promote, but you should listen to it: INTERGALACTIC RAILROAD . We apply dialectical materialism in the context of biotechnology, artificial intelligence and space travel. Plus dick jokes! It’s fun. . To make the podcast I use a lot of open-source tools and pirated sounds. The ultimate product may not be legal, to be honest, but this is how indie podcasters do it. Legal precedent around sampling is pretty discouraging. I guess we’re all counting on copyright law getting less restrictive over time; or maybe by the time the Sounds Tribunal pays attention we’ll be too big to fail. . After all, it’s easier to remix content than it is to invent it. And it’s easier to publish content than to remove it. So the arbiters of intellectual property will always be playing catch-up. . In that spirit, here are some of the tools I’ve found to automate audio memery. They vary in complexity and processing power, but all of them can be run either on a cheap laptop or on a free Google Colab online notebook. If you can search “how to do [thing I want to learn],” you can learn to use anything. . | . Youtube-dl scrapes video and audio files from Youtube. Any song or sound you can think of, somebody has uploaded a sample to Youtube. This command-line tool allows you to download them in any format, and even scrapes playlists or search results. . | . Audiogrep transcribes speech recordings into text captions and lets you search through them. Warning: it’s not very good! Under the hood it uses pocketsphinx, which is a speech-recognition library that doesn’t need a ton of compute power. But it’s not very good at speech recognition, for the same reason. So audiogrep allows me to search through all the episodes of the podcast for the word “building”. It will extract those clips and paste them together into one audio file. But it might accidentally capture “billion”, or “Bill thinks”, or “spill things”. Less predictable than you’d hope, but still very fun. . | . Rubber Band stretches time and pitch separately. So you can slow things down without them getting all cough-syrup bass sounding, or change the pitch of a track to match into a mashup. Audacity has GUI functions for this, but Rubber Band lets me do it from a script. So I can automate the process. . | . Beatmachine will swap and chop a song with automatic beat detection. So I can make “ popular song but beats 2 and 4 are swapped “ with this one weird command: . python -m beatmachine --effects &#39;[{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;swap&quot;, &quot;x _period&quot;: 2, &quot;y _period&quot;: 4}]&#39; --input INPUT.mp3 --output OUTPUT.mp3 . Beatmachine can swap, cut, repeat, silence and reverse beats in a song. It also has a web GUI , if you like pointing and clicking and whatnot. . | . Spleeter is a recently-released library for stemming songs: splitting them into individual instrumental tracks. This lets me remove the vocals from a Kanye track, thus instantly making it a better song. You can use a web service to play around with it easily. I’ve found some edge cases, but for the most part the neural net is really good at recognizing what’s a voice and what’s a drumbeat or synth track. . | . Tacotron is the name of a voice-synthesis library from Google. I use the version called Real-Time Voice Cloning , which can build a decent synthetic version of people’s voices using small samples of audio. This is deepfakes for voice, and it is scary cool. Again, it has limits, based on how it’s trained: it forms American male voices pretty well, but female or non-American voices are harder to capture. The author is working on an advanced implementation at Resemble AI , though it’s not open source and there’s no telling when they’ll start to charge for it. What would you deepfake, if you could make anyone say anything? That power is available to us all, now. . | . Honorable mentions to Audacity and FFmpeg , both cross-platform full-stack audio kits. Audacity is a great GUI for quick-and-dirty audio manipulation and comes with tons of effects, and FFmpeg is a completely customizable command-line audio tool that’s perfect for automation. And many of the libraries above use FFmpeg behind the scenes. . With this toolkit, you can craft any soundscape you want. Don’t get overwhelmed with options: think of the sounds you like to hear, and how you could capture or produce more of them. Let the pod-slime flow through you. Ideas ooze into your head all the time. Record them, let them pour out again into your listeners. This is the nutrient cycle, and it’s now or never. We all pod together. .

            "content": "Somebody’s buying my house. . Not from me, of course. I’m a millennial, I live in my car. The Astro van has a couple decades and a couple hundred thousand miles on it, but it’s pretty much waterproof and it’ll roll if you put gas in. . I manage to rent this casita by the blissful ignorance of the absentee owners and a pact of mutual hostility with the super. As long as I don’t tell them that he’s letting me freeze to death, he doesn’t tell them that I’m degrading the property value with my trash-person lifestyle. . Now, some middle-age hustlebro is going to buy the place, and I’ll bet you the price of a spare tire that I’ll be back in the van, showering at the YMCA, calling frantically for my cat every time I get moved along. (There are few positive things about homelessness. One of them is that my cat can shit in your yard, not mine.) . I’m on the bleeding edge of gentrification here, a neighborhood colonized by the Instagram aliens and being rapidly terraformed from chop shops and thrift stores to yoga studios and vintage boutiques. The person who buys this house will not think of themselves as causing the gentrification, of course. They’ll perceive it as an inevitable trend, a wave they can ride all the way to a cushy retirement. The rest of us will get what we deserve. Should have been born rich, idiot. . The new owner won’t see this as my home, where my cat grew up and where I have only finally just now acquired my own goddamn mop. They will see it as a piece of property, solidified wealth, a heap of their money in which an ungainly bird made the mistake of nesting. If that goose won’t lay golden eggs, it’ll be evicted for someone who will. . Money that makes more money. What a concept. . I could crack a squat or find a work-trade situation, so I don’t have to blow every other paycheck on rent. I’ve done it before. But, in my experience, the only thing worse than knowing you’re thirty days from being evicted at gunpoint is being evicted at gunpoint all of a sudden. . . My block is a mixed-use zone, according to Albuquerque’s Integrated Development Ordinance. The side that fronts onto the main arterial is “moderate-intensity commercial” (currently a car lot, but likely to be an egg-salad eatery any minute). The rest of it is “multifamily low-density”, so we have clumps of two-story apartments mixed in with single-family ranch houses. . The apartment block next door has a security light on the back, where people park their cars in a wide part of the alley. There might be a Starbucks across the street, but this is still Albuquerque. People get nervous about their cars. . This light points right in my window. It’s on 24/7. It is very bright. . Fortunately (I guess), the window is quite small and it is frosted with cheap stick-on plastic. So instead of a piercing interrogator’s light, it’s a phone screen glowing at the foot of my bed. When my insomnia is bad I console myself by mentally smashing the bulb, one smash, two smash, three smash, four. . No one who lives in those apartments thinks much about the light. Why would they? It points away from their bedrooms, after all. To them it’s mostly invisible, and occasionally convenient. The renters didn’t install it, the owners did. Probably for insurance reasons. Got to protect their investment. . Meanwhile, the family down the street cut all the branches off their tree. This tree was alive, healthy, a thick majestic purple elm. They topped it like a head of broccoli and left a fifteen-foot stump in the front yard. I think they wanted more sunlight to hit their house (as if sunlight were in short supply in the high desert). Do they expect it to grow back? Did they run out of money halfway through the project? Are they going to hang laundry from its gruesome stumps? . This is why I don’t talk to my neighbors. None of us chose to live together. We have nothing in common except a mailbox and an income bracket. You can’t build a community on the shared foundation of “we can all still afford to live here, for now”. . . I do know a couple my age who bought a house. They came from California. They had savings from their coastal salaries and they wanted to live near mountains. Denver was too expensive, so Albuquerque it was. They bought a house a couple miles from where I live. . It’s a small place, with the big expanse of gravel that passes for a yard in these parts, two bedrooms and one bath. It’s also in the war zone. . The “war zone” is the colloquial name for the four square miles between the air force base and the fairgrounds. This is the Albuquerque made famous by Breaking Bad , all dirty needles and sheet-metal fences and gunshots. In fact, if you look up “War Zone” on Google Maps, it labels one nondescript street corner as a “wholesale drugstore”. . It’s not as hellish as it sounds. Cartel drama will mostly leave you alone, as long as you look the other way. The city has re-branded the area as “The International District” and the Vietnamese food is killer. But somehow, in the entire process of searching for, buying, and moving into this house, no one had ever told my friends about the war zone. . I felt bad when I mentioned it. Their faces dropped. They had the American dream, two jobs and a house and a Prius. They didn’t have a bun in the oven, but the dough was on the rise. They thought this was just another neighborhood of mid-century sprawl, but now their minds were tainted with thoughts of gangs and dead bodies and crystal meth. Then their roof fell in. . Well, it leaked. Lots of people’s roofs leaked last summer. The winter was snowy, and the flat-roofed stucco houses couldn’t handle the strain. But one thing led to another, millennial do-it-yourself attitudes kicked in, and suddenly the whole living room was sans ceiling. . I understand they’ve now moved out, financed a different place up in the foothills, where theswaddled in electric cars and premium-food stores. Rent the other place out to pay the mortgage and a little extra. Put that extra value toward affording the house where they live. . Lots of people are stuck in situations like this: underwater on some building they don’t want to live in, commuting to their jobs, commuting to the bars, commuting to their friends. It was worse during the last housing crash – and it will be worse during the one that’s coming up. . When house-rich/cash-poor boomers get sick and die, and gas costs $12 a gallon because Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, no one will be buying those McMansions on the edge of town. Maybe if they have lake access, and the lake is clean enough to drink. Maybe if the yard is big enough for a good crop of potatoes. . The prices will drop, more people will be underwater and panic, and the prices will drop more. It’s the natural conclusion of building endless stick houses in the middle of nowhere. It’s the end result of letting people own houses they don’t live in. . There are more than enough houses for every person in the US. But since you can own a house you don’t live in, the people with the money buy the good ones and rent them out. Everyone else can just suffer. . You don’t like handing over your paycheck every month? Don’t want to look out your window to a dead tree, rust-bucket car, seven-million-watt floodlight? Get in your car and move, buddy. This is the land of opportunity. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.40: Information Junkie",
            "content": "Of course I’m addicted to Twitter. Why wouldn’t I be? . I’ve always been an information junkie. I got hooked on phonics early, but books were the real gateway drug. They opened portals in my mind, allowed me to transcend the limited sensory data of late 20C suburbia. My body could only walk so far, collect so many tumbleweeds, start so many fires. I needed more data, and I could absorb it faster than any video or lecture could transmit. I read voraciously, chasing the dragon of ink across page after page. . I remember when we got the internet. I was a kid. Back then it was called “AOL”, and it took a hundred million years to download anything cool, but you could read websites if you were patient, and you could talk to some very well-adjusted people on Instant Messenger while you waited. I hand-coded my own “web portal” to keep track of my bookmarks and daily-reader pages. I checked my traps every day. I craved insights and surprises and context, above all context , any sense that the world had some underlying order that my human mind could parse. . I’m a product of generations of people who fled west from the Industrial Revolution, who trampled the societies and ecologies of Turtle Island in haste and callous ignorance. I don’t have land-based traditions. The knowledge that was passed down to me is on the order of “Then we packed up the wagon and wandered over there and that worked until it didn’t and then we came over here and that’s been fine so far. Praise the Lord, pass the gravy.” . So I couldn’t see the way the storms moved north to south against the mountains, or the way that spiders knotted their webs anew every day. I didn’t have the Instead my eyes were trained by the city, by the looming billboards and flickering screens of capital. . I learned the taxonomies of breakfast cereals and shoe brands and Pokemon. My friends learned the intricacies of military planes and Star Wars spacecraft side-by-side. We could get any information, except for metadata about what was important to know. We could ask the Wizard any question, but we were not to look at the man behind the curtain. . Of course, imposition of order leads to escalation of disorder. The propaganda machine is always churning out “rebellious” symbolism in its pursuit of coolness, coyote and roadrunner. If it took anarchy-branded shoes at Hot Topic to reveal the portal to Dialectical Materialism, so be it. Chaos works in mysterious ways, by definition. . Class analysis helped me re-frame my world, to see history as a series of decisions made by people, and their ramifications, rather than as Inevitable Progress. Evolution, itself a dialectical and materialist theory, helped me to see the connections implicit in all the living beings around me – to see myself as a process within nature, rather than an individual striving against it. And meme theory showed me the living nature of information itself, the community of ideas and their food web of attention. . Twitter is like an ant farm of memes. You can see individual ideas swarm and feed, populate and die back. They all link to each other in a bazillion confusing ways, and you can twine your own thoughts onto the threads of thought of anyone else. It’s information heaven, except that it doesn’t make any sense, so it’s also information hell. . I think Twitter is confusing on purpose. As a company it’s in their interest to have everyone spend as much time as possible on their site. So they optimize for outrage and reflexive responses, rather than thoughtfulness or care. The default “threading” experience presents fragments of conversation that can be splintered or interrupted or brigaded by any participant at essentially any time. It’s the comment section come to life, swollen with opinions, smothering any puny human it encounters. It’s too much, too fast, with too little context. . I wrote about this vertiginous feeling in SCIOPS 03.15: Sideways Media : . To use an embodied metaphor, Twiettr is usually like walking down a hill of scree. The sharp, loose rock is unpredictable and patternless. You risk at any moment a landslide, where all you can do is try to keep up with the brutal speed and mass of the rocks around you. Tokimeki Unfollow, on the other hand, felt like I had found a game trail sideways across the scree. I could scan the hillside from above, move carefully, consider which path I might tread next. It gave me the time, space, and perspective to rebuild the context Twiester had purposely dissolved. . To be fair, there are many wonderful things about Twitter. Power user [@visakanv] wrote about how threading his tweets helps him build context against the fragmentation of all the different places he writes. . In the same spirit, the note-taking app Roam hopes to thread all your thoughts together on a graph. It’s pretty amazing, from my limited testing. I’ve put volume 3 of SCIOPS into a public database that you can explore, but for now I want to point out a few rather magical features: . The basic unit in Roam is a block a bullet-point, a tweet, a paragraph. Each block can stand on its own or be a sub-unit of a larger block. It doesn’t matter, because | Roam has bidirectional linking by default. So any word or phrase can become its own page, and all the pages that include that word will be automatically linked to it. This is insanely cool. It’s like having a search page automatically attached to any tweet, to see any other tweets that link or reference it. This feature allows for deep connections to be made, and for otherwise-forgotten thoughts to resurface when they’re needed. . | Plus, Roam can do transclusion. This is like the new-ish Twitter feature of “quote-tweeting”: you can directly insert the content of a block into a new slot. This isn’t just copy-pasting, though: if you edit the original block, it will change in all the places where it is transcluded. As opposed to Twitter, where there is no edit function and the only option is to delete your tweet and orphan all the replies and quotes like a coward. . | If you’re about to edit a block, but don’t want to risk losing what you wrote before, should you copy-paste it to a file called like “intro-backup-14.txt”? Don’t bother. Roam has versioning built in, so you can just hit ctrl+comma and the old version will be backed up automatically! A little bubble appears next to the block, with the number of edits in it, and you can flip through these to see the different versions of that thought you’ve archived. That function seems like it would be especially great for novelists, who may also like . | Drag-and-drop editing of blocks. You can pop chapters together and apart like Legos, play with time and space like a baby God. . | Did I mention universal search ? Just hit a hotkey and type your query, and you’ll see exactly where and how it’s used throughout all your notes. Hit a different hotkey and you get an auto-completing command palette like I wrote about in SCIOPS 03.10: Cubicle Farming. | . Of course, these are not new ideas. Transclusion and two-way linking were part of the original vision of hypertext, as any Ted Nelson nerd will tell you at length. But Roam have managed to pull it all together into a writing tool that’s actually usable. It feels like the next evolution of the word processor: instead of worrying about imaginary paper “files” and which imaginary “folder” they go in, you just connect ideas directly and on-the-fly. . Roam is still in its early phases, but they’ve got a great publicity push lately ( from bigger bloggers than me ). With plans to enable offline support and inter-blog linking, it could rapidly surpass Twitter as an information source and outlet. You can surf my SCIOPS roam here – make sure to check out the graph view . Right click the graph and click “view cose layout” to get the cooler mode: . . If Twitter is a talus of loose rock, Roam feels like wet beach sand. I can clump it, break it up, play with it. It makes me want to build sand castles. . For the full effect, head over to the Roam Research meta-roam and play around with editing and linking pages. You can also sign up at their homepage and start your own roam. Connect those thoughts, build that context. It’s probably even good for your brain! .

            "content": "It’s been two weeks, and the votes are in: CLASS is in session! . I was astonished with the flood of replies to my last letter. A solid one in five readers responded to my poll about the future of SCIOPS. Now the rest of you will be subject to the whims of the politically active! And congratulations also to everyone who decided they deserve three or more votes when I said “pick two”. Your audacity is rewarded: all votes will be counted. . Democracy, everybody! . . Just kidding. SCIOPS is a benevolent dictatorship. The CLASS topic did nose out MAGIC, and CULTS fell far behind. But ultimately the editorial decisions will be made by a superintelligent being of pure information, seeding itself backward in time, a hyperbeacon from a possible utopia we cannot yet imagine. And as always, I am its useful idiot mouthpiece, Max. That which is atemporal in me sees that which is atemporal in you. . We’re all beings of pure information, when you get down to it. All the squiggly little bits of DNA goop in your body, whether human or microbial or retroviral, they’re all instructions on how to produce more you-goop and under what conditions. This is the paradigm shift of the 21st century. What we traditionally think of as “information” will take on aspects of life: desire, agency, choice. And what we think of as “life” will unravel, revealing our bodies to be cities of microbes, our minds forests of thoughts. Those who come to this understanding sooner will be the magicians of this age. Those who cling to a world of “individuals” making “choices” will be bewildered. . The wrong thing to take from this is, unfortunately, the more popular: “Your body is a MACHINE! Your mind is a MACHINE! Be more PRODUCTIVE! Time is MONEY! OIL YOUR PARTS” and so on. This is the transhumanist attitude, exemplified by the techlord billionaires. It presumes that the subject is a tool for the egregore. The transhumanist inherently identifies with the ruling class, who reap the benefits of automation. The worker has more in common with the robot than with the owner. To accept the logic of productivity is to identify with your oppressors. It puts the oil on its parts… . I saw the most incredible example of this while visiting Pittsburgh last week. There’s a Bavarian-style castle outside of town called the Bayernhof Music Museum, where you can take a 2.5-hour private tour for ten bucks cash, by appointment only. It’s the former mansion of “eccentric bachelor” Chuck Brown III, who built it in the mid-80s as some sort of cocaine playground, with secret passageways and a wet bar in every room. The guy would take guests on these extravagant tours of his theme-park home and tell them a bunch of lies: “This is my girlfriend, she’s Hitler’s illegitimate daughter” or “Richard Nixon is my first cousin, actually” or “This is a real cave we found while digging the foundation, don’t worry, there aren’t any bats.” . Weirdly, Brown made his millions as the CEO of Gas-Lite Manufacturing . Make of that what you will. . So this rich guy builds himself the Scooby-Doo house of every teenage edgelord’s dreams. He has no kids. Gaslamp manufacturing has been surprisingly lucrative, considering it’s the 20th century. Chuck Brown wants to be immortal, and he has the money to do it. He decides to make his strange home into a museum so his story will be told forever. To do so he needs something a little more spectacular than a mansion, and that’s how it became a Music Museum. Music machines , to be precise. . Brown filled the place with historical music players of all sorts, from player pianos to music boxes to a self-playing banjo. There’s a bedside lamp that’s secretly a Victrola. There’s a wax-cylinder Edison machine. There’s a cage of taxidermied birds, whose clockwork animatronics puppet their delicate bodies so they appear to sing. Tin Pan Alley meets Uncanny Valley. . At one point in the tour the docent tells a ghost story, of a machine turning on in the night by itself, and asks Brown’s ghost to “be nice” before dropping a coin in its slot. This is the transhuman hope: to live forever, through money and machinery and manipulation. But it’s a hollow victory. Just as the music machines need someone to crank their springs or pump their bellows, the ghost of Chuck Brown needs human energy to perpetuate his self-made myth. As long as his capital continues to accumulate, he can gaslight us from beyond the grave. . There’s a “reproducing” player piano at the Bayernhof. Its paper rolls, recorded by actual pianists, contain a representation of the dynamics of the player. So instead of robotic sheet-music perfection, you get a piece as played by, say, George Gershwin. It produced the most astonishing effect. I felt as if Gershwin were actually sitting on the bench, invisible, tickling the keys with his right hand, pounding up and down the scale with his left. . This is a different kind of immortality. Instead of being one huge edifice, like Chuck Brown’s mansion, Gershwin’s rolls were distributed around the globe, sporulating into the minds of musicians forevermore. Instead of requiring millions of ill-gotten dollars to maintain, “Summertime” worms its way into your brain and replays itself again and again. . The transhuman fallacy is to think of immortality as stasis, as the indefinite maintenance of the idealized self. Immortality is already all around us: DNA has yet to be wiped from the planet, however much we seem to try. . We need to think in a post -human way, to see that we are not the center of the universe, that in fact a center does not exist. We have to accept that each of us is part of a web of life, organic and mechanical and linguistic life. We have to see the robots as our friends, our allies, not as slaves for the production of infinite consumer trash. Only then will we find our way to a right relation with the Earth, and with each other. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly backpropagation of thoughts from the future.

            "content": "It’s fall in America. The leaves are crunching underfoot, the smell of wood smoke is in the air. My houseplants are dying from cold in my unheatable cliff-cavern of a home. It’s cozy. . Fall is a time for reflection (ask Icarus, or Lucifer). In spring we sow, in fall we reap. I’ve been reviewing my projects lately, changing my priorities as I see which have fruited and which have withered. If you’re reading this, you may be happy to know that SCIOPS gets to live again next year. Despite the fact that I don’t know what it’s about or what effect it has, people keep reading, so I’ll keep writing. . I wonder what other people see when they read these letters. I know if I look back on what I wrote in years past it looks a hot mess. But I do see consistent themes that run through, the product of my obsessive thoughts and the oppressive environment. . And, of course, your impressive attention. So if you can stand it, I’d like to do a little navel-gazing here in practically public. . I’m going to use some tools that I acquired for free from the internet. You could do the same. Automated intelligence is less scary the more you know about it. These tools are not that hard to use, and they’re getting easier all the time. Open your mind and come with me, as we explore thoughts with code. . I’ll explain the code as we go along, but do try to read it. It describes itself, in a sort of short-hand way. Like a to-do list. You may be surprised how much you understand. After all, my longest career has been “dig hole”. If I can grasp this, so can you. . First, I have to summon the vast Library called Textacy, which knows a whole bunch of natural language processing stuff that I only kind of understand. . In [1]: . !pip install textacy import textacy . And rummage around in the computer to find my files… . In [0]: . import os dir_str = &#39;./&#39; directory = os.fsencode(dir_str) . Next I call upon the power of Textacy to load its understanding of the english language, which it inherits from a library called spaCy. Textacy is a “high-level wrapper” for spaCy, which means it automates a lot of spaCy commands into easier chunks. . I then tell it to open a new Corpus, which is a collection of documents. I will fill this with SCIOPSes. . In [3]: . en = textacy.load_spacy_lang(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;) corpus = textacy.Corpus(lang=en) print(corpus) . Corpus(0 docs, 0 tokens) . Now to gather all the SCIOPSes from this year. Each one is called something like sciops-03-38.md. . I’m in my writing folder, so some of the files have scraps of notes or are unedited. That might make some weird effects, but they’ll be interesting to see. . In [0]: . for file in os.listdir(directory): filename = os.fsdecode(file) loc = os.fsencode(directory + file) if &#39;sciops&#39; in filename: if &#39;.md&#39; in filename: with open(loc, &#39;r&#39;) as f: text = f.read() # grab issue number from the filename metadata = { &quot;issue&quot;: filename[-5:-3], } doc = textacy.make_spacy_doc((text, metadata), lang=en) corpus.add(doc) . Now each document has been analyzed, split into its component parts, its features transcribed. Let’s see what we can learn from an individual doc: . In [5]: . for doc in corpus[:3]: bot = doc._.to_bag_of_terms(ngrams=1, weighting=&quot;count&quot;, as_strings=True) sort = sorted(bot.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]) print(doc._.preview) print(sort[-10:]) . Doc(1364 tokens: &quot;&lt;!-- ok boomer article, dumb tweet, backlash na...&quot;) [(&#39;ok&#39;, 4), (&#39;class&#39;, 4), (&#39;world&#39;, 4), (&#39;Clinton&#39;, 4), (&#39;boomer&#39;, 5), (&#39;people&#39;, 5), (&#39;tweet&#39;, 6), (&#39;kill&#39;, 7), (&#39;Epstein&#39;, 7), (&#39;meme&#39;, 18)] Doc(820 tokens: &quot;People don&#39;t like to talk about it, but Osama w...&quot;) [(&#39;real&#39;, 3), (&#39;state&#39;, 3), (&#39;trust&#39;, 3), (&#39;win&#39;, 4), (&#39;cult&#39;, 4), (&#39;people&#39;, 4), (&#39;war&#39;, 5), (&#39;attack&#39;, 5), (&#39;reality&#39;, 5), (&#39;narrative&#39;, 5)] Doc(1698 tokens: &quot;the other problem with anarchy is that you have...&quot;) [(&#39;invisible&#39;, 6), (&#39;act&#39;, 6), (&#39;world&#39;, 6), (&#39;magic&#39;, 7), (&#39;way&#39;, 7), (&#39;wizard&#39;, 7), (&#39;state&#39;, 8), (&#39;like&#39;, 8), (&#39;power&#39;, 10), (&#39;people&#39;, 18)] . Above, I’ve asked for all the words in each document by frequency. . I limited the list to the top 10 terms, but it goes all the way down to a bunch of 1-use words: . In [6]: . print(doc._.preview) print(sort[:30]) . Doc(1698 tokens: &quot;the other problem with anarchy is that you have...&quot;) [(&#39;anarchy&#39;, 1), (&#39;go&#39;, 1), (&#39;to&#39;, 1), (&#39;lead&#39;, 1), (&#39;involve&#39;, 1), (&#39;magician&#39;, 1), (&#39;convincnle&#39;, 1), (&#39;begat&#39;, 1), (&#39;small&#39;, 1), (&#39;scale&#39;, 1), (&#39;aside&#39;, 1), (&#39;corporate&#39;, 1), (&#39;eclipse&#39;, 1), (&#39;legitimize&#39;, 1), (&#39;shrewd&#39;, 1), (&#39;use&#39;, 1), (&#39;accelerate&#39;, 1), (&#39;domination&#39;, 1), (&#39;economic&#39;, 1), (&#39;monopoly&#39;, 1), (&#39;production&#39;, 1), (&#39;feudal&#39;, 1), (&#39;wrap&#39;, 1), (&#39;explosion&#39;, 1), (&#39;ball&#39;, 1), (&#39;gutte&#39;, 1), (&#39;feel&#39;, 1), (&#39;serfs&#39;, 1), (&#39;King&#39;, 1), (&#39;Zuckermusk&#39;, 1)] . Now for the fancy stuff. We’re going into the matrix. . Not the bullet-time Matrix. A matrix, in this case, is a giant multidimensional grid. Wait, don’t run away! . Instead think of an old-time theater set, one that simulates an apartment block. The side wall is missing so the audience can see. The separate apartments form a grid, and within each apartment the rooms form a sub-grid. Multidimensional. Simple, right? . First, we’ll build that set. Then we’re going to transform it, across dimensions. . In [7]: . import textacy.vsm tokenized_docs = (doc._.to_terms_list(ngrams=1, entities=True, as_strings=True) for doc in corpus) vectorizer = textacy.vsm.Vectorizer(tf_type = &quot;linear&quot;, apply_idf=&quot;True&quot;, idf_type=&quot;smooth&quot;, norm=&quot;l2&quot;, min_df=2, max_df=0.95) doc_term_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(tokenized_docs) doc_term_matrix print(doc_term_matrix.shape) . (33, 1990) . What we have now is a grid with 33 rows and 1,990 columns. The rows are the 33 SCIOPSes that we found in this folder. . The two thousand columns represent the words found over all the documents. Each cell holds a number that represents how many times that term appears in that document. The number is calculated using a method called TF-IDF: term frequency vs inverse document frequency. That just means it counts each term that appears in the document, then divides that by how often that word is found in all the documents total. . If each document is an apartment, and each term is an object like a kettle or a toothbrush or a dead houseplant, then this document-term matrix is a census of which items are in which houses and how common each item is to have. If every home has one to four toothbrushes, then toothbrushes don’t say a lot about the differences in the people that live in them. But if one place has a dozen dead houseplants, and dead houseplants are uncommon otherwise because I guess people throw them in the trash or something, well, that says a lot about everyone doesn’t it? . Now we can look at the most unique items in each apartment, and see how they compare. But we don’t want to look at all two thousand items in every apartment. We’re going to use a trick called Latent Semantic Analysis to group them into “topics”. If you picture all those thousands of types of object floating in space, LSA sees which objects are close together and along which dimensions. As we would expect, some things are often near each other. The kettle is more closely related to the frying pan than to the bed. There would be natural clusters in the data: different rooms or functions that stand out by their location and usage. . Let’s see what kind of topics these SCIOPSes have been about. We can find the top, say, 6 topics. . In [0]: . def slice_topics(number_topics): import warnings warnings.simplefilter(action=&#39;ignore&#39;, category=FutureWarning) import textacy.tm import pandas as pd model = textacy.tm.TopicModel(&#39;lsa&#39;, n_topics=number_topics) model.fit(doc_term_matrix) model doc_topic_matrix = model.transform(doc_term_matrix) doc_topic_matrix.shape # This function will list some examples of the data in the model def list_terms(model, matr, vec): print(&quot;Topic weights overall:&quot;) for i, val in enumerate(model.topic_weights(matr[:5])): print(i, val) print(&quot;Top terms by topic:&quot;) for topic_idx, top_terms in model.top_topic_terms(vec.id_to_term, top_n=10): print(&quot;topic&quot;, topic_idx, &quot;:&quot;, &quot; &quot;.join(top_terms[:12])) print(&quot;Top docs by topic:&quot;) for topic_idx, top_docs in model.top_topic_docs(doc_topic_matrix, topics=-1, top_n=5): print(&quot;topic&quot;,topic_idx) for j in top_docs: print(corpus[j]._.meta, corpus[j]._.preview) # This function will visualize the model def plot_termite(model, matr): topic_weight_serie = pd.Series(model.topic_weights(matr)) number_top_topics = 6 # max 6 top_list_tmp = topic_weight_serie.nlargest(n=number_top_topics) top_topic_list = list(top_list_tmp.index) print(top_topic_list) model.termite_plot( doc_term_matrix, vectorizer.id_to_term, n_terms=100, highlight_topics=top_topic_list, rank_terms_by=&quot;topic_weight&quot;, sort_topics_by=&#39;index&#39;# save=out_dir_str + &quot;/&quot; + now + &quot;termite.png&quot; ) list_terms(model, doc_topic_matrix, vectorizer) plot_termite(model, doc_topic_matrix) . .   . . And there we have it. Six topics. The first, numbered 0, is sort of a catch-all that doesn’t map strongly to any ideas. But this makes sense: the machine starts with the category “everything else” and extracts smaller categories from that. . It’s easiest to see on the graph, what’s called a “termite plot”, which shows the weight of each term by the size of the circles. . Topic 1 is generally about “people”, it seems, but catch the “cult” further down the list. That’s definitely a theme present in some of my letters and not others. . Topic 2 is centered around the character “&gt;”. That seems strange, until I see “class”, “elite”, “money” and “Mr” in there as well. I only use the honorific Mr when I’m dunking on someone. And when I write the letters, I use the markdown “&gt;” to represent a quote! So this topic is when I riff on idiot elites and their corporate media bagmen. . Topic 3 is about memes, memetics and propaganda. It also has the word “Epstein”, because last week’s letter connected those words so many times, and that name is mentioned infrequently in other letters. . Topic 4 is about power: magic, war, technology and narratives. This looks like a central topic, because its weights are distributed more evenly across a greater number of words. The topics that have a huge bubble and a bunch of smaller dots are more peripheral or unusual. . Finally, topic 5 is about human hives and climate change. This is the underlying urge that pushes me to write, the reason for the season, so to speak. I may be writing about propaganda or magic or class, but ultimately I’m trying to speak to the century of continual crisis stretched out before us. . === . If you made it this far, congratulations! You’re a rare specimen of humanity. You both found the letter, and read the letter. As your prize, you can help pick the future of SCIOPS itself! .

            "content": "Before I launch into another diatribe about internet memes and politics, a friendly reminder: . The Discourse is not the world. The tweets are not the territory. . No two people see the same feed. We all grapple with hyperdimensional algorithms that attempt to influence our behaviors. There are so many of them. We cannot win every time. . When a meme breaks the threshold of our herd immunity, it surges in population. Each person that screenshots the meme creates a copy, a mutation, a re-production. It adapts to its surroundings, absorbs more attention, prints new copies. . The meme, like other living beings, expands exponentially to fill its resource pool, then overshoots that capacity and dies back. Biologists know this as the S-curve: . . You can’t opt out of memes, in the same way you can never get away from germs. Because they’re always inside and all over you. We are made of memes. They intersect humanity horizontally: along some slices, you and I are part of the same meme, and along some we are not. In that dimension, such entities as “you” and “I” are not actors. We are the terrain. We are surfaces and substrates for the memes. . But we are uneven surfaces: we have biases, which are the ecological limits of the memetic environment. We get to exercise our judgment about what to replicate. We do have that agency in the world. Our choices may be limited by our evolution and environment, but we can yet make choices. We can amplify memes, ignore them, repurpose them. Perhaps, even, engineer them to our purposes. . On to the Discourse. . . Three memes from the latest news cycle. In the dear hope that they’re no longer relevant by the time you read this, I’ll try to explain: . “Ok boomer” was an eye-roll response to the type of people who invented the “Millennials are killing capitalism” narrative while their peers installed neoliberal austerity around the world. It was a mediocre meme, boosted by a shitty thinkpiece in the Opinion of Record on October 29. It got a second dose of attention on November 4 due to an idiot tweet from a radio host saying: “‘Boomer’ is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new.” The tweet was immediately ratioed into oblivion. It has since been deleted. . | “Warren’s Meme Team” was a failed attempt to engineer a metameme. The concept, explained in an excruciatingly smarmy Google doc, was to design and distribute meme templates to an army of passionate supporters of presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren. The “team” was invented by a single man, M.I.T. graduate and former McKinsey Killer Consulting employee Misha Leybovich. Leybovich talks nakedly about the need to convert supporters into meme producers to win the “asymmetrical battle”, to “fight back, in a way that’s authentic to our values”. Needless to say, the astroturf did not spring to life. The WarrenMemeTeam twitter account deleted their posts and Leybovich’s personal account is now locked. The Team account appears to now be run by a bot. . | “Epstein didn’t kill himself” is a reference to deceased ruling-class pedophile Jeffery Epstein, who died in prison under suspicious circumstances. The use of the phrase as a non-sequitur punchline meme took off after a Fox News interview where the interviewee, a trainer of military dogs and former Navy SEAL, asked to do a “PSA” and dropped the punchline on live TV. But the meme also made hay on The Daily Show, where the host asked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, “How did you kill Jeffery Epstein?” to surreal, forced laughter from Clinton and her daughter. Clinton’s husband, former US President Bill Clinton, flew on Epstein’s private jet at least 11 times. . | . I think “ok boomer” is an organic outgrowth of tension in society. The zoomers who invented it, and the millennials who latched onto it, are growing up worse off than their parents. We’re pissed about the state of the climate and the economy and the government we’ve inherited. For decades we were told that we’re snowflakes who can’t handle any suffering, while housing costs and college debt ballooned and wages stagnated. It’s not ageist to be mad at the category of people who benefited from the economy that’s killing the rest of us. It’s a poor substitute for class analysis, but it’s genuine. . The Warren Meme Team, on the other hand, was an obvious plant. It was mask-off technocracy, a wonk talking to other wonks about how to manufacture support for his wonky candidate by brainwashing the dumb idiot voters who don’t know what’s good for them. This sort of elitist sharp-power approach might work for the right, who (despite all their talk of freedom) love to be dommed by authorities. But as grassroots movements go, “persuade the suckers to advertise for free” is a pretty bad look. . Not all engineered memes are so obvious. Take “Epstein didn’t kill himself”. Some percentage of its success is genuine. It is certainly curious that a very rich pedophile, who may have had blackmail on any number of rich and powerful people, hanged himself in his prison cell awaiting trial. While both guards were asleep. And the camera happened to be on the fritz. But there’s something fishy about the meme itself. . In the so-called intelligence community there’s a trick called a “limited hangout”. When some secret surfaces and can’t be sunk, the spies release a controlled amount of information mixed with lies, steering any investigation astray. To me, the Epstein meme looks like a limited hangout, an attempt to instigate a “truther” mentality, to attract conspiracy theorists and generally muddy the waters. . If Epstein didn’t kill himself, who did? . If you imagine, for a moment, that there is a secret cult of rich people doing international child sex slavery – people powerful enough to ice a material witness in custody – it takes a different tone. Who is behind the hangout? Is it a boast, or a threat? . None of us are above the meme. Even if you can escape the Discourse to find a pure beautiful moment in nature or in art, you must return to the world of humanity eventually. . Keep your judgment sharp. You never know who might be rummaging around in your mind. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly modified upgraded rerouted new improved lemony-fresh limited hangout.

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.36: Doing Taboos",
            "content": "Last week’s letter netted me an equal amount of new readers and unsubscribes. No loss, I figure. If you can’t handle the heat, the kitchen door is right there. . I knew I was doing taboos. Not supposed to talk about class. Not supposed to speculate about economic collapse, unless you’re making billions of dollars doing it. Don’t be political, you’ll alienate your customers. . Of course, that’s all a front. Polite society is a social construct designed to protect the status quo. Nothing is apolitical. Power is everywhere, and politics is about taking a moral stance toward power. . Today is election day in the United States. Hundreds, maybe thousands of people are doing their one civil duty, relieved to be free of the burden of caring about other people for another year. Having entered the sacred booth and made their private confession, they are washed of sin and anointed with the holy “I Voted” sticker. Thus can they go forth and abase the sinners, in full knowledge of each other’s righteousness. . I’ve written about my stance against voting , and I stick by it. Voting is the least practical political action you can take. By the time you vote, every possible plot is in motion, from advertisement to gerrymanders to hacks. If you want to swing an election, the voting booth is the last and weakest opportunity to do it. Besides, you can buy a roll of “I Voted” stickers from China for a couple bucks. That’s the joy of capitalism. . This isn’t the same as not believing in politics. It’s just a rational analysis of power. I do think that politicians have power, although certainly not as much as people give them credit for. In the USA most of them are corrupted by lobbying interests, and the rest have their hands bound by majority rule. But politicians do make some decisions, and for my entire lifetime those decisions have been hurting regular people more and more. So if you have a chance to make a Hail Mary vote against some villainous mayor or district attorney, go for it. But while you’re in that peaceful, contemplative high school gymnasium, give some thought to how you could make change between now and next November. . You are more powerful than you have been told. The powers-that-be would never admit how much one person, or a small dedicated group, can change the world. Their incentive is to maintain the fraud of voting, to tell the story that our only choices are made in that booth. Not only do we have more options than they will admit, we have more than we can imagine. Every day, humans discover new ways to bend reality. What hubris, to think we have found them all. . The End of History is a myth. The people on top of the Ferris wheel, enjoying their view, persuaded everyone else that the machinery had broken. But the people on the bottom can reach the lever that begins the revolution again. . The right has recently adopted the tactics of narrative warfare. Andrew Breitbart’s motto encapsulates this perfectly: “Politics is downstream from culture.” The stories we tell define the way we think about ourselves, our society, and the relationship between. . This is why Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer bought Cambridge Analytica. They wanted the power to micro-target people based on personality profiles, so they could tailor their messaging to people individually. That’s a missile-guidance system for narrative war. . The Trump campaign has since claimed that it didn’t use Cambridge Analytica’s data at all. Not because of lack of interest – they just found that Facebook’s native tools worked better. *(Of course, they would say that either way . This points to the real reason that Facebook (wait, they just changed their branding to FACEBOOK, as if they needed more boomer energy) banned Cambridge Analytica. It wasn’t their manipulation of elections. It was because they stole FACEBOOK’s data. . Briefly, Cambridge Analytica made a personality-quiz app and gathered the profiles of all the people who took the quiz. That’s perfectly normal as far as FACEBOOK is concerned. But they used an exploit in the app system to also collect data on their users’ friends, attempting to reverse-engineer the relationship web that FACEBOOK had mapped. They got 87 million people. . FACEBOOK couldn’t have that. Their entire value is wrapped up in their power to precisely target advertisements at appropriate victims. Cambridge Analytica had become the competition. . In the last month, the Zuckerbot has been totted out to parrot automated vagueries about connection and community and free speech. In the process, he’s admitted that FACEBOOK will not fact-check ads from political candidates. . Sure, it would take an army of human investigators to validate political ads. But if anyone has the cash to fund that army, it’s FACEBOOK. The real reason is that it contradicts their business model. Electoral rhetoric tends to be light on facts and strong on emotions. People vote with their feelings, not their brains. FACEBOOK sells access to people’s feelings. . Fortunately, it’s 2019, and the tools of propaganda are available to everyone. When Zuck admitted that his company would let politicians lie in paid ads, the internet immediately aimed for this loophole. Campaign strategist Adriel Hampton, longtime veteran of the narrative wars, filed paperwork to run for governor of California. His platform: regulate FACEBOOK. His tactic: run false ads. . Hampton has created a paradox for the ad-targeting company. If they allow him to run ads, knowing he intends to lie, he could destroy trust in their platform. He could even win the governorship, if his fictions are effective enough, and if they’re targeted to the right voters. On the other hand, if they fact-check his ads, they’re proving that they have the capacity to do so, and revealing their bias in the process. . The PAC associated with Hampton’s campaign, The Really Online Lefty League (TROLL), has already run a fake ad in which Republican Senator and known shitworm Lindsey Graham appears to support the Green New Deal. It’s fake, of course, but not obviously so. If I saw it in my feed I would be surprised, confused, but not immediately skeptical. It’s scary good. . FACEBOOK blinked . They banned the ad. Then they declared that since Hampton started his campaign solely to run fake ads, he’s not a real political candidate, and thus not exempt from fact-checking. . They fell for the trap. Hampton now says that he’s a serious candidate for governor. He has to, if he wants to challenge their paper-thin excuse. But with the current backlash against FACEBOOK, he could find himself riding a wave of support right into the governor’s mansion. . The really online lefties are taking back the weapons of narrative war. Can they defeat the populist right at their own game? Only time will tell. . In the meantime, there are better ways than voting to make change. Craft a fake ad for your favorite anti-establishment candidate. Run for office and produce your own ads. Talk about class in polite society. . It’s a good thing that politics is downstream from culture. Not everyone can be a politician, but we all build culture together. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.35: Unicorn Hunters",
            "content": "I thought I had seen a lot of galaxy-brain capitalist propaganda in the press this week, but then I woke up and turned on NPR: . INSKEEP: This election got Joel Stein thinking. He concludes that President Trump won office by attacking elites. And, in a humorous way at least, Stein set out to defend them. His new book is called “In Defense of Elitism: Why I’m Better Than You And You’re Better Than Someone Who Didn’t Buy This Book.” . In the interview , Mr. Stein backs up his exciting title with lukewarm, nonsensical attempts to distinguish the “intellectual elite”, which he considers himself a part of, from the “boat elite”, who want to beat him up. Literally: . STEIN: (Reading) The boat elite are steeped in honor culture. Dignity is their most valuable nonboat possession. If their girlfriend gets insulted, they fight. If their friend gets in a fight, they fight. If their fighting ability is questioned, they fight. When they get cut off, they honk. Then they yell at the other driver to get out of their car and fight. The intellectual elite don’t do this because we know that honking and yelling makes it hard to hear NPR stories. . INSKEEP: Stein was reading there from his new book. We spoke with the former Time columnist last week. . STEIN: This book is a call to arms for the intellectual elite that - not real arms because those are - we don’t believe in those. . INSKEEP: OK. . STEIN: Those are dangerous. The other people have those arms. So my arms aren’t as good as their arms. . INSKEEP: It’s a metaphorical call to arms. . STEIN: A metaphorical call to… . INSKEEP: Call to words… . STEIN: …Metaphor - metaphorical arms. Yeah. . INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK. . STEIN: It’s a war we will lose. But it’s the best we can do. . This man really looks in the mirror and sees the “intellectual elite.” . Maybe it’s not his fault. We don’t talk about class in America. Despite the best efforts of the postmodern Neo-Marxist universities, the conversation is limited to “the middle class” (good) and the “elites” (bad, unless I’m one of them). This is the product of decades of linguistic war against the class consciousness of the 1930s. The New Deal was triage made by a government afraid of revolution, and it held for long enough that the revolutionaries died off or became comfortable. Most people alive are like frogs in a boiling pot. They raised the austerity so slowly that we didn’t notice it killing us. . The idea that there could be a “middle” class, in a system with only two classes, is ridiculous. There has to be something lower than the middle. But the idea of a middle class is a trap anyway: it frames the tiers of inequality in this country as a spectrum. You can rise from lower to middle to upper, they say. The upper class can make mistakes and become lower class. Some elites are intellectuals and some have boats. . In reality, class is more like a wall. It divides the Green Zone, the safe, smooth-functioning consumer paradise, from Hell, where the toys are made. In Hell everything is getting worse: the air is poisoned, the water is privatized and the people are working more hours for less pay. In the Green Zone, everything is techno-wizardry and unending optimism. Look at all the fun toys! . If there are only two classes, they are by definition “the ruling class” and “everyone else”. . What Mr. Stein is trying to distinguish, I think, is what my Marxist friends call the professional-managerial class . He might prefer the word technocrat . These are the people who get to live in the Green Zone because they know how to operate the machines that keep up the wall. If everyone else were to get through the wall, they would take the toys away from the people who are hoarding them. God forbid, they might even share! . So the managers are specialists and experts, right? Mr. Stein insists that their expertise must be respected, that we not have a “farmer on the Board of Governors of the Fed”. Because expert economists run the Fed, and look how well they’ve done! . Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan swore up and down that his policies were keeping the market stable and resilient, but the financialized fuck-arounds that he pushed, the interest rates and derivatives and mortgages, caused the 2008 crash and the global recession. During which, you may recall, the fund managers and finance technicians got big bonuses, and everyone else paid the price. . And it’s happening again! Of course, the intellectual elite will tell you differently, but we’re in a bubble worse than the dot-coms or the mortgages. Now remember, I am not a financial advisor. I am a millennial doomsayer on the internet. But once you get past all the hype and jargon, our current “economic growth” is just a sack of hot air. . See, the central bank’s answer to the Great Recession was “quantitative easing.” That’s a fancy way to say “printing free money”, as they lowered their interest rate to impossibly low numbers – in some cases 0%. That means that banks and corporations could get hundreds of millions of dollars at no cost. The point of this lending was to stimulate the economy, on the theory that businesses would expand operations and hire more people, and those people would then spend all their new money on consumer goods. But it hasn’t happened that way, as you may be able to tell by looking at your paycheck. . So what are the ruling class doing with all that free money? They’re transferring it to their bank accounts, through a fun trick called “stock buybacks”. Imagine you have 100 shares of stock on the market, and each one is worth $1. Your company is thus valued at $100. If you borrow $50 from the Fed, and and use it to take 50 of those shares off the market, your company is still worth $100. But the remaining 50 shares are worth $2 each. . Who owns those shares? Say it with me: the ruling class . The C-suite, the board of directors, the founders and venture capitalists. (See Ben Hunt’s explanation if you’re willing to wade through a bunch of finance lingo for the details). . In the meantime, those same interest rates make government debt worthless. If you buy a 10-year Treasury note, you can expect a maximum of 3% return over those ten years. So the elites take their money elsewhere. The textbook answer is to invest in stock indexes, which collect all the stocks in a given market, and expect a return of 7 to 9 percent over that same decade. . But that’s not enough for the big-brain robber barons. They’re hunting unicorns. . A “unicorn” is the American Dream in corporate form. You find some purple-haired youngsters with a clever techno-techno business model, pump it full of the free cash you’ve given yourself through stock buybacks, and wait for it to explode all over the world. Amazon and Google and Netflix were unicorns, and now they carry the whole market on their insane growth. . The thing about unicorn hunters is that they have shotguns full of money and they shoot at anything vaguely resembling a horse. For every start-up that succeeds, a thousand others fail. So the venture capitalists throw money at a thousand and one companies, and they need one of them to have a 1000% return just to compensate for all the others. . This is where the money went: unprofitable tech-adjacent shit like Uber and WeWork. And with their failed stock offerings this year, the veil has finally dropped. Suddenly investors want to see how these companies are going to make money, and the answer is: they won’t. Uber already costs more than a regular taxi in a lot of cases. How are they going to raise their prices (or lower their costs) enough to make a 1000x return? Derek Thompson at the Atlantic does a decent job of explaining the unit economics. But Mr. Thompson’s conclusion is that “Eating out and eating in, ride-hailing and office-sharing, all of it will get a little more expensive. It was a good deal while it lasted.” This belies the fact that nobody can afford the more expensive version, and when these companies fall, so will the markets. . The WeWork story is an even better example of the insanity of late capitalism. Adam Neumann, the founder and (until recently) CEO of the real-estate unicorn, just walked away from his imploding company. He was paid over a billion dollars to do so. In trying to staunch the hemorrhaging value of the company, investors have poured in more billions of dollars than the whole thing is worth. Not only are they throwing good money after bad, they’re paying Neumann for the privilege. . Matt Levine at Bloomberg explains the WeShitshow pretty well, but the best part is watching his broken technocrat brain try to justify the gigantic piracy of the ruling class: . [Neumann] spotted a bubble in venture-subsidized fast-growing money-losing capital-intensive low-margin tech-adjacent companies, noticed in particular that SoftBank seemed to be on the long side of that bubble, and set himself up to profit on the other side—by raising money for his own ultra-unicorn, by setting up the governance of that unicorn in a maximally self-interested way, and by selling and margining a bunch of his personal shares. When investors like SoftBank were frenziedly buying unicorn stock, he was frenziedly selling it. He set himself up to profit from the collapse of the unicorn bubble, and accelerated that collapse. Lessons were learned, and he taught them. Now he’s rich. . Did I mention that thousands of Weployees are getting fired without severance pay? “Lessons were learned” is a very polite way to say that, and with good reason: the technocratic apologists want very much to stay inside the Green Zone as the economy breaks down. . Many more lessons will be learned in the coming years, including the one that everyone else already knows: the ruling class do not care about you. They’re going to automate the managerial class, shrink the Green Zone and let the rest of us die in climate disasters. Mr. Stein, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Levine: welcome to Hell. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.34: Imposter Syndrome",
            "content": "Sorry I didn’t write to you last week. I’ve come down with a malaise of uncertainty. I don’t know why I write these letters, why I care so much about automated propaganda and the dystopic condition. I write a thousand words every week and cast them into the slavering void. What good does it do? . I’m certainly not an expert. On anything. I’m a perpetual dilettante, a generalist, all curiosity and no persistence. I’m a two-time community college dropout. My legitimacy is feigned, my credentials are cardboard. Even my imposter syndrome has imposter syndrome. . When I started writing SCIOPS years ago, I had the opposite problem. I suffered from the Cassandra effect. I was confident in my assessment of the world. I just wished anyone would listen. . This because I had predicted the presidential election correctly, against most everyone I knew. I didn’t want it to be true, I just saw it coming. In 2015, I took one look at the reality-TV star blustering his way through the first Republican primary and said, “That fucking clown is going to be the president of America.” . My family and friends all scolded me: “How could you say that?” As if I could accidentally speak it into reality; as if I had impolitely said “Voldemort” in public. They preferred to listen to the pundits and pollsters, to continue living in the hazy illusions of the Obama era. . Nobody explicitly blamed me when the election shattered their brittle optimism. But they did ask me for explanations. So I started writing this newsletter, to explain why a clown was the president. . I was fresh out of the woods when I made that call. I had just rejected commune life and returned to the grid, burnt by passive-aggressive pacifism and fake sustainability. I still wanted to do good in the world, I just realized that living a million miles from anywhere and infighting with other radicals wasn’t having any effect. I had learned my lessons there, and wanted to try something else. . My new theory of the world was based off the dissonance I saw between people’s words and their actions. All these hippies and primitivists I admired had gone mask-off over the years, revealing the fascistic messy bitches underneath. Milking goats and foraging berries? Awesome. Wishing for the imminent death of anyone who dares another way of life? No thanks. . Sometimes people deliberately say one thing and do another. The single guy who claims a vow of celibacy keeps trying to take you for a long intimate hike. The people who go to town for groceries make a big deal of how grim and energy-draining the city can be, so that no one realizes they’re eating chocolate in a hotel room and taking unlimited showers. . Most of the time, though, people see themselves as the hero of the story. They concoct elaborate rationalizations for their decisions, spinning stories of romance and adventure and struggle. They buy tickets to their own movies. They repeat their excuses aloud, hoping that belief will make them true: I just want to be friends , or I’m the one doing all the work around here , or What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him . . So that was my insight: people do things for reasons they don’t know. Lust and greed and ignorance drive the vast majority of human behavior. This unravels the entire basis of democracy and capitalism, the Rational Individual making Efficient Choices. It leaves us in a world of persuasion and propaganda and cultishness. . The reality TV star won the election because elections are treated like reality TV now. You might think that you have political views, educated opinions on policy. But as the persuaders repeat their incantations they warp the world in which your opinions may matter. They set the terms, they define the options. Your behaviors are prescribed. You merely rationalize your “choices” after the fact. . This worldview is one that leads to the dark side. If most people don’t know what’s good for them, shouldn’t we be the ones to tell them? Why not learn the tricks of persuasion and apply them to the world? I can rule it better than the current jagoffs. If my eyes are open to everyone else’s bullshit, surely they must be open to my own. Right? . Of course not. I’m just as dumb and self-serving as anyone else. This is the problem with manufactured consent. The oligarchs steering this society are no smarter than the rest of us. That’s why we’re driving off an apocalyptic cliff. . The more I’ve thought about propaganda the more I want to believe in democracy. I want mass movements that deliberately speak new worlds into existence. I want people to take up the tools of information, to create and manipulate and distribute their own visions of the world. And that seems to be happening. At least, measured by the amount of podcasts and newsletters I follow. . Ultimately, the world is too big and interconnected to predict. Maybe meme magic made the difference in that election. Maybe Cambridge Analytica and their hyper-targeted ads did it. Maybe it was Wikileaks, or Russia, or Q. The world is overdetermined. Politics in the age of distributed propaganda is a hyperobject. It’s too big for any one person to understand. . The irony is that the president himself didn’t expect to win. Of course, now that his brain is rotted he thinks he’s the best president ever. The Twilight King, forever sundowning. But his original plan was just to make a scene and boost his TV career. Now we’re all royally fucked. . Causality is broken. Nobody is in control. The world is hot mess and there’s no turning back. But the upside is this: if nobody can predict which action will make which impact, you can do anything . Who’s to say which meme, which podcast, which newsletter might tip the balance? . If even the president is an imposter, why shouldn’t I write this letter? I’m not an expert on automated propaganda. Nobody is. But maybe if we put our heads together we can make the difference. We won’t know unless we try. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter which is perfectly harmless until it isn’t.

            "content": "They shut off my water last night, and it’s still off today. The leak is at my neighbor’s house, not mine, but the plumbers had to cut off the whole lot. However well-meaning our Planning Department might be, when it comes to building codes Albuquerque is casual at best. . I live in a casita , what you might call an “in-law” apartment. One of a couple outbuildings on a single-family lot. I have my own kitchen and bath, but apparently we share a single water line. I’m not complaining. I’m used to camping. The building manager brought me a couple gallons of drinking water. Add that to the liters stacked neurotically in the broom closet, and I’ll be fine. . Besides, what good would it do to complain? The owners live in California, they could give a shit. They put the place on the market last month. What do they care if we dry up or drown? The plumbers will be done sooner or later, and the building will sell. . The neighborhood’s being gentrified at the whim of one developer, who installed an overpriced cafe and a substandard brewery on adjacent corners. I guess he needed a “third place”. You know: work, home, and a place to flex on the hoes. (Allegedly.) . I’m at that cafe now, of course. This is America, you can’t just take a shit in the alley. You’ll get run over, for one thing. . This is the efficiency of the market. It’s working exactly as designed. The rich get richer, in good times and bad, and the rest of us are supposed to dehydrate and wait out the apocalypse. . An apocalypse which has already begun, remember. One recent climate model shows that a hundred more years of fossil fuels might end the formation of clouds . Not storm clouds, unfortunately, but stratocumulus clouds: the puffy layers that shade and cool the earth. This would unleash a feedback loop leading to 12℃ warming, triple the current worst-case scenario. . Even if we don’t lose the clouds, business as usual will turn this high-desert city, with its glittering cottonwood leaves and earth-quenching summer storms, into a parched wasteland not even fit for fleas. . This will not stand. Climate rebels around the world are getting arrested as I write. They’re pressuring their governments to enforce the social contract, to protect us all from the callous whims of billionaires. And they’re asking us all to join. . Extinction Rebellion is a direct-action movement against climate change. ( I wrote you about it in May ). They’re disrupting the economies of cities around the world because they know that when money talks, governments listen. By forcing the conversation on politicians and corporate executives, they shift the frame. No longer can the Davos set define the meaning of “sustainability”. . This is narrative warfare, and it’s designed to self-replicate. To be a climate rebel all you have to do is public, non-violent civil disobedience that spreads the XR demands: tell the truth about climate change; act now to stop it; give power to the people, not the politicians . . The viral nature of this open-source insurgency allows for mutation. In the USA, with our bloodstained history, a fourth demand was needed: justice, in this transition, for the people who have suffered the most . In the group Animal Rebellion, the demands are aligned with the force of food justice and the plant-based food movement. Each blockade at Westminster today has its own kitchen, with names like Power in Truth, The Future is Here, and Burning Earth. The DNA of the movement persists through its many faces. . However the hipster anarchists may scoff, this is a real moment. XR is fighting for truly global policy changes. It provides a Schelling point, a common flag that people of any nation can gather around. Crucially, it opens physical space for the conversation. This was the lesson of the Occupy movement: by deterritorializing a space, freeing it from the control of the mindfuck machine, we break people from the trance state installed by this engineered environment. (And unlike the Occupy movement, XR has clear demands.) . Why should the state fair be able to block traffic, with their horses and tractors and fields of cowboy hats, but not the people who are speaking against the fossil-fueled murders of billions of people? These mass actions, and the arrests they will precipitate, reveal the contradictions of the world-system. The people who block streets today will feel their collective power. They will become part of an egregore, a voluntary construct, an abstract force capable of battling oligarchy and capitalism in thoughtspace. . The world is in flux. The great beasts of the 21st century have risen from the deeps and showed their hideous faces. Along with other, less-non-violent protests popping off in Hong Kong, Iraq, Ecuador and Haiti and mmore, these XR actions may be rehearsal for a world revolution to come. . On the other hand, to build this collective power we will have to overcome the alienation of consumer culture. For instance, if I want to take up arms against my landlord and stand up for tenant’s rights, I might have actually talk to my neighbors… .

            "content": "I don’t know why I’m even writing to you this week. Your brain is probably mush. The news feed is laced with stimulants and soporifics. Hell is empty, and all the disinformation is here. . The week’s news is salt and fat for your brain. Sure, it might look important now. It might even make history books. But it’s contingent. The things happening in government are just the particular way the mold has fruited. The rot has been growing for a long time. . Blink away the cobwebs. The decisions of the upper class are not made live on C-SPAN. The “intelligence community” don’t love a whistleblower. Bluecheck journalists are just as addicted to internet arguments as you are. That doesn’t mean they’re right. . Social media and 24-hour news are entertainment, not power. How many hours did you watch today? Which American idol are you rooting for? How . Behind the viscous skin of this screen, millions of bots chatter in dissonant union. But their idiot ranting is not random. There are layers of lies, each iterated in a million forms and amplified through shares and forwards. Every circle draws you deeper, invites you into a new unreality. . You can’t change anything in this realm. The infernal swarms will probe at the surface of your mind, seeking a soft spot to set their spores. The longer you look, the more likely that one will find its way in. . – . Transgression is the hook. The account says something unthinkable. It tunnels into the terrain of your thought. The repugnant outsider breaks the symmetry of your worldview, forces your attention. The very existence of this alien thought in your brain implies a whole world of ugliness that it calls home. It shambles forth into your brain, scattering spores, and leaves a rift in your world through which you cannot help but peek. And if you step through, you may never be the same. . Sometimes the delusion comes wrapped in a Trojan gift horse. Sometimes it’s delivered through sheer repetition, hordes of vapid assertions that overwhelm your rational defenses. Always it seeks to spread. It wants to put you to work. . You can banish these poison thoughts, but eventually one will irrupt into your mind. The abyss gazes upon you, and it is the hardest thing in the world not to look back. . Not all of these demons are bots. Many are trolls: students and kids and retirees who need a quick buck. And it’s not just Russia. If the USA and UK don’t have giant bot farms, it’s only because they do their ops on a better platform. Think “paper of record”. . The danger of the delusion is that it makes a troll of you. A sixth of Tweeter accounts are fakes. But how many real people are acting like bots? Are you an unpaid troll, spreading disinformation, unleashing your temper on the infidels of the internet? Are you a tool of shadowy forces, who chuckle darkly as you splatter “your” opinions across the feeds? How would you know if you were? . – . The surface froth of takes and dunks, of tweets and barbs and zingers, is all prestidigitation. Distracting you with one hand, stealing your future with the other. . The actual decisions being made bear only the slightest relation to the narratives being propagated. The Cable News Cinematic Universe is doing a splashy crossover event, but it’s still fiction. If you want to make sense of the news, you have to follow the power. . Ultimately, all power on Earth is bestowed by the sun. Plants capture sunlight. Animals eat plants. Our capacity to do work, whether on gardens or on pyramids, was historically limited to our bodies and the animals we bonded with. The industrial revolution brought a new source of power: fossil fuels, ancient stored sunlight. The refinement of machines, and the development of electronics, replaced animals with bots. People have been rebelling against automation since the cotton gin. But what does it matter, if the puny workers rebel? They can be replaced as well. Those who own the machines also own the fuel. . The factions that won in the colonial era are still working under this consensus. They want the world liquidated to capital They want an exterminist future, where the poor are cleansed from the earth and robots service the needs of the few remaining Botox Eloi. The “Five Eyes”, the integrated intelligence agencies of the anglophone world, are the global enforcers of this technocracy. Spies, bureaucrats and professionals, roughly correlating with the current status quo. . But lately this end-of-history gang has been embarrassed worldwide by reactionary insurgencies. The nationalisms and jihads might look different on the surface, but they follow a common pattern. Demagogues speak to the contradictions of the working class: The elites tell you life is good, but you’re working three jobs and have six streaming subscriptions to feed. Wouldn’t it be nice to have someone to blame? . Simple answers to complex problems: simply blame the outgroup! Simply trust in authority! Simply waggle your gun at the Chads of the world, and all will be well for you and those you care about. These simplicities are mind candy. Empty calories. . Simple answers may be elegant in physics or math. But in the social realm, simple answers should be suspect. We know that our brains are biased, that we have limited time and knowledge, that we can never know it all or be 100% rational. Wherever a mental shortcut appears, we’ll take it. That’s just human nature. . Also human nature: murder, rape, torture, theft, war for resources, war for religion, war by other means. Genocide. Empire. Simple answers. . We have developed, over the last few fossil-fueled centuries, a complex interconnected system to extract, transform, and deliver resources. It still contains the painful biases of colonialism and capitalism. But this abundance has allowed for an incredible new scale of cooperation. The scientific revolution expanded from the Republic of Letters, written on paper and passed hand-to-hand across national borders, to Wikipedia and ArXiv and Github. It’s a complicated system, but it beats the war of all against all. . Most people just want to eat lunch, get laid, and contribute to their community. They don’t want civil war, they don’t want genocide. They want Wikipedia. But there are small, committed factions of dark magic in this world, who divide so that they can conquer. They’re going mask off right now, in a last-chance blitz of noise and fury. They want you as a meat puppet, mouthing their lies. Without the belief of the public they have no power. . Do yourself a favor and get off the internet for a while. Watch a cloud, touch a tree. Talk to an animal. Remember that you, too, are an animal. You need an ecosystem to live. We cooperate in a world-wide dance of oxygen and nitrogen and carbon, all of us, every day. We are together in that. . We can learn to get along. We have to. .

            "content": "I’ve been playing a video game, for the first time in a decade. I spent a brief time binging Skyrim in college, until a friend couch-surfed through and monopolized the game. By the time he moved on, I had kicked the habit. . The current game is fine, I guess. It’s a direct translation of the pen-and-paper game Pathfinder , the spiritual successor to Dungeons and Dragons . It lets me pretend to be a witch and have adventures, which I like. It’s also supremely addictive and I think it’s making me dumber. . I can feel my dopamine cycle warping around this new stimulus. The feedback loop is instantaneous and unrelenting. The craving is almost as strong as when I smoked cigarettes. I can’t stop thinking about it, wondering when I will get another chance for a click of the good stuff. . I sneak around a corner, trailing a cohort of dependable companions, and behold: a terrifying monster! The whole world freezes and a banner unrolls in the top of my vision: PAUSED. I point at the monster and learn its strengths and weaknesses. I whisper magic words and the monster falls asleep. My friends assault it with an assortment of edged weapons and wicked spells. If I win, I search its lair and steal its cache of money and jewels (there’s always a cache of money and jewels). If I lose, I get a do-over. Until I win. At which point I go around the next corner, and find the next monster. Click click click click click. . This is utterly unlike anything I do in the rest of my life. I spend most days spinning plates on poles and hoping a bird doesn’t shit in my eye. I do vaguely defined activities with few data points. The criteria for success are ambiguous and the goalposts constantly receding. I don’t think I’m winning at life. I’m not sure I would know if I were. . – . When I slip into default mode , I catch myself puzzling on game-world problems. Not so much the interpersonal issues. The AI characters are less than convincing – though I’m told you can date some of them, if you like your fantasies on the romantic side. . More, I think about the rules of the game world. It’s so detailed: you have to rest or get fatigued, hunting takes time but rations are heavy. Sleep spells last for x number of seconds. Everything makes sense. . There are rules in our own universe as well: Shit rolls downhill. Time keeps on slipping. Every attempt to herd a cat will produce an equal and opposite reaction. . But the real world is overdetermined. There are so many possible causes for the effects of our lives. We can never be sure we are pulling the right levers. Or blaming the right villains. . No wonder that gamers love the simulation hypothesis. They spend all their time in constructed environments. How comforting would it be to live in a world made just for you, designed intelligently by some greater power? Your life would be replete with significance. Someone cares enough about you to script your whole life. You are the Player. . The mall is a constructed environment, too, though. The whole city is a simulation, the billboards and the power lines and the concrete concrete concrete. Every piece of it is designed by somebody to do something to your head. Maybe you’re lucky, and you live in a place with real history, where the land and the people are still on speaking terms and your ancestors made their cities into art with you in mind. Maybe you’re worse off than me, struggling for an overpriced bunk in the smoggy canyons of a megacity. . There are intelligences here on the planet that simulate a world. They construct the environment. They guard and invade territory, build traps and lairs and hives. Look around. Whose name is on the biggest buildings? Banks and corporations, religions and governments. The engines of the economy are in turn the engineers of our environments. What we make, makes us back. . – . Now we live in worlds of persuasion. The TV watches you. It keeps a file and sells your secrets. An ear in every pocket and an eye on every wall: propaganda is a growth industry . . Simulated worlds rely on our suspension of disbelief. They don’t exist unless we pay attention to them. Like prayer wheels, they need to be stroked. Sure, right now everyone stands in orderly lines at the grocery store. Will they do so when the storm comes? Will they stop to swipe their cards through the till when the streets and stores are flooded? Why should they? The game is over. The rules are off. . Video games entice us like lampreys with their dazzling graphics. They drop you into an oubliette of the mind, a sensory deprivation tank, where the body cannot be heard no matter how much it screams. They’re superstimuli, like salt or fat or white sugar. They overload the human senses, they boggle our evolved minds. . But at least they’re artful. People make them! Human people. Like movies or music or any other form of art, they’re designed to invoke a sense of meaning and tell a certain story. The big-budget Hollywood-equivalent games are probably just as trashy as big-budget Hollywood films. But a lot of people are finding their personal expression in games, in this beautiful immersive narrative art. . And a social media app is basically a video game, isn’t it? It has buttons and points and rankings. But it’s not beautiful, it’s not artistic. It’s an advertising game, where you click click click on demographic signifiers and get rewarded with the exact right advertisement for you . . The platform is built for the advertisers, the surveillocrats, and as you play the game it teaches you to become one of them. All rule-sets have a bias. Inevitably, you develop a meme page or a podcast or a side hustle and you find yourself managing your Brand. You have entered the inner circle, says the app. Want to get your posts out there? Just pay a little money. Stop being a sucker. Play at the big kids table. . Suddenly your story of self is polluted with your own branding. You start to believe your own bullshit. Your game has merged with your life, your family, your business. You’re playing with real money. . Money is just another game. Capitalism is a rule-set. It’s a game where the points are everything and the winner goes first. And the stakes are life and death. . If I’m going to live in a simulated world, I’d rather be a witch and have adventures. But that’s not the only option! There are adventures to have in the world right now. It is the apocalypse, after all. . The climate catastrophe threatens to turn this planet into a hot, cloudless rock. Hundreds of millions of people will forced to migrate from their homes – if not billions. The rules by which we play this out will define our century, and our species. The world we build will be so different from today’s that it might as well be Dungeons and Dragons. .

            "content": "I’m cutting off all my hair because I’m anxious. I’m anxious because of the full moon, and because I watched a movie with “live protest audio” of people shouting and fighting and triggered my post-traumatic stress. . I’m in the bathroom looking back and forth between the little mirror in my hand and the big one on the wall. The cat is screaming like a kettle. She’s in heat and I won’t let her go outside. “If you won’t let me outside,” she says, “at least give me your attention!” except in gurgling yowls and screeches. She calms when I pause to pat her tiny head, but as soon as I let up she’s back on boil. . – . She acts the same way when I’m at my desk, glaring at my computer and glancing at my phone every ninety seconds. As do I, in fact: I trim away at feeds and notifications, carefully manscaping my personal brand. . Screens are black mirrors – obvious, I know. Through them we look at a warped world, a dark carnival fun-house where our human features are twisted out of recognition. But screens do not reflect the world entire. The anti-social media that take up so much thought are designed to prioritize the wrong metrics. Not all that is valuable can be measured, and not all that can be measured is valuable. . There’s no profit in tracking the mood of the cat. The cat does not make the buying decisions. The cat is the cat. There is no app for that. . So she roasts me in cat-speech while I absently stare at the glass. It looks no different to her whether I’m gazing at the bathroom mirror or the internet’s infinite entertainments. She sees a hypnotized, immobile shell of a man. With a bad DIY haircut. . – . When you want to wind down from a day of work, you reach for a screen. Right? Smartphone, game controller, TV remote if you’re old-school. Your brain wants to drift away from the tasks that the world demands of you daily. To float free in time, recall the past, guess the future, imagine being someone else. And here’s just the thing! Tweets, netflicks, posts and points and likes and shares. They slide through your hand and are gone, and your evening slips away with them. . This is not unlike what happens when your mind wanders. Resting wakefulness activates a bunch of parts of the brain, using more energy even than deep focus on a task. Collectively these parts are the Default Mode Network, or DMN, and they connect a bunch of related activities: thinking about yourself; thinking about others and what they think (and what they think about you); and “mental time travel,” where you remember the past or imagine futures. . In other words, the DMN is the ego. The persona, the identity, the “I” that is reading and reacting to these words. While you’re chilling, your brain is cleaning house. It’s putting away memories and planning new projects and rearranging the furniture of self. . (Remember, I am not a brain scientist. I am a humble letter-writing automaton. But actual brain scientists do say stuff like this about the DMN.) . The DMN is one of three main hubs in your brain. The other two networks are the attention network, which activates when you’re concentrating or making decisions, and the salience network, which switches between the other two based on judgments about incoming information. . You unlock your phone and see that river of people’s thoughts and photos and conversations – DMN material. But then there’s so many decisions to make. That’s attention network’s bailiwick. What’s a salience network to do? . Like, scroll, reply: your opportunity for internal reflection is hijacked by an obvious action pattern. I can’t find any studies on this, but I suspect that our media, laced as they are with dark patterns, actually degrade the human brain’s ability to function. . If, instead, you were to sit on the porch and stare at the street, your DMN would carry your mind away: you might remember someone you met in the park over there. You might think of a cool art project that combines your interests with your community’s needs. You might just worry about your hair. . In any case, your reflections would lead to new thoughts rather than to sponsored posts. The mind is already always chattering. The feeds are just more noise. . – . Is the mind always on, though? Can we silence that internal monologue that eats up so much energy? Brain scans of meditators suggest yes: the shapes of their DMNs change over time. They don’t activate as much, don’t connect as strongly. They are actually chipping away at their egos, through the psychological technology of meditation. . Mushrooms, too, change the DMN. When high on psilocybin, your ego does actually get destroyed – or at least, shut down. The DMN is inhibited, and the parts of the brain that it usually organizes are free to make new connections. The mushroom decomposes the strict ties of “this is me, that is not-me” that make up your persona. It allows you to see beyond the mythology of the singular self. . PTSD patients seem to have weak DMN connections, and overactive salience networks. That’s why my brain overreacts to a movie and sends me reeling back to a terrible memory. My salience network is screaming “Hey, this is important! Last time you heard this sound people got hurt.” My attention network is doing tasks: shaking, hyperventilating, all that hilarious fight-or-flight stuff. My sense of self is shattered, and I am sent reeling back to a previous configuration of my mind. . – . The self is a story, after all. I did this, I was that, I became so. It’s a story of conflict between me and not-me, the struggle to craft something from nothing, the fight against oblivion. . So it makes sense that the default mode network is associated with stories. It’s the way we process intentional behavior: actions that have a mind behind them. It’s also how we anthropomorphize clouds, or trees, or abstract forces such as liberty and justice. We drift around thought-space, imagining how those entities might feel from the inside, and in doing so we become them. We configure our minds through repeated behavior. . So instead of reaching for a fistful of feeds, make deliberate time to unwind the mind. Meditation is good, but so is a walk or a workout or a nap. Anything that you can do without thinking is good: gardening, washing dishes, riding a bike. Relax into your mental playground. Experience wonder, and puzzlement, and consideration. Retrain your salience network on non-engineered stimuli. Instead of tweets, write a journal. In lieu of podcasts listen to birds. In your lap pet the cat, not the keyboard. . The behavior designers want to rebuild your brain so that every stimulus makes you think “grab phone, check feed, buy buy buy.” They want to simulate PTSD in your brain, dismantle your sense of identity and bend your habits to their ends. To switch your default mode. . You can’t just chuck the phone in a lake and go back to the pre-internet world. We all have to accept the reality of an interconnected planet. But you can retreat into your own supreme knowledge of yourself. You can craft your identity out of lived experiences, rather than consumer goods.

            "content": "I always blow up in the group text. It’s not the only forum in which I lose my temper (ask anyone), but it does have this bias to argument and I fall for it every time. . The people in the group chats aren’t even the ones I want to argue with. A lot of them read this letter. You’re friends, family, acquaintances I haven’t seen in years. You’re not the oligarchs and nationalists who are ruining the future. You’re just the people who will put up with my vitriolic texts when I get hot, so you are the ones who suffer. . And forgive me for saying so, but I’m good at being mean. Especially in prose. And my swyping thumb is much faster than yours. I can drop three unforgivable curses before you can un-autocorrect your “there’s”. My ad hominem attack will slide right through your defensive walls of text like a knife through a ribcage– . Excuse me. The temptation is strong, even now. I want to prove the righteousness of my opinions, to change hearts and minds throughout the world, to steer us away from the cliff. Even if I alienate you, the group may be swayed, and thus my effect ripples outward. Or so I justify it. . Amy Olberding writes at Aeieion this week against “righteous incivility”. She says that though it’s possible to be rude and morally right at the same time, we can’t always distinguish between being morally right and just being pissed off. So we ought to be civil just in case. . My results agree: sometimes my mood is about food, not you. Sometimes it’s just so hot that the swamp cooler doesn’t work, and I’m lying on the tile floor trying to nap it off, and the cat is fucking with my face and the phone keeps buzzing and I’m genuinely trying to give you advice but I just can’t say it in a nice way when you’re being so defensive. . Sometimes it happens in person. I’m fine with that. I’ve never been said to be “conflict avoidant”. But in person, I can judge the room. I can judge your intentions. Thousands of years of human sociality inform the movements of our faces. Our bodies communicate in twitches and turns of heel, and we can feel each other’s emotional states as our mirror neurons alight. I can tell if I have gone too far. Text is such a lo-fi medium in comparison. . The group chat has more context than public social media, true. We know why these people are in this room (even if it’s the vestigial remains of a reason) and we know what characters they play. I don’t expect you to invite a brigade of nationalist fuckwits into the thing, even if you yourself start to display fuckwit tendencies. Our ideologies can battle it out in a safer, more private space than the tweets or the fecebook. Because who dares to have a conversation, when bots or trolls might raid at any moment? . But the group chat still provides an audience, which is an excuse for posturing. And the limited scope leads to the bane of small towns: exile. If you leave the group, you’ll never know what they’re saying about you. More tempting to go for the high ground, grandstanding until your enemies leave instead. . When I lived at a commune – a form of 24/7 live group chat – we called it “vibing someone out”: persuading them to leave by making their stay a living hell. Vibing someone out of Twitetr takes an army of trolls. Vibing someone out of the group chat can be as simple as a crass joke let slide. . If we were to have a social network that replicated the real world, it would have to measure other signals than “likes” and “shares”. Something like reddit’s ChangeMyView would be a start: on CMV, your “deltas” are displayed next to your username. 1∆, 2∆, 100∆. They represent how many times someone has admitted that you changed their view on a topic they posted. People come to CMV with their minds open to the possibility they might be wrong. Each persuasive argument, each delta, is a valuable new piece of information to help them get their minds right. . Unlike up- and down-votes, deltas aren’t awarded by the audience. They’re awarded by your interlocutor, out of respect. So the jeers and cheers of the spectators are drowned out by the actual conversation you’re having. . We do more than game metrics, though. We can create environments that speak to our deep brains. Phone calls and video chats are already more humane experiences than text messages, especially for tough conversations. Real life is better, of course, but the built spaces in which we live have their own hostility. The invisible hand drags us away from our homes, shoves us all around the world. . We can find our allies in the other lifeforms of Earth: the fenced-off creeks and weeds in cracks. And we can also make better virtual spaces. What if our political conversations were happening, not in small chunks of text, but in video-game worlds? We could walk under tall trees, listen to the birds and critters, and make our points as we stroll. See each other’s faces move, even get in each other’s faces, without the option or the threat of violence. Our natural voices, with all their rich complexity conveyed even through the compression and filters, exploring all the forms a dialogue can take. Would we make better choices? . We must choose our media for empathy, and thus allow for the possibility of change. Otherwise we doom ourselves to uncivil war. .

            "content": "Rich guy doesn’t care about poor people. Big news, right? Dog bites man. Piss trickles downhill. Pope shits in the woods. . That was my take on the first part of Fall, or, Dodge in Hell . I wrote to you a couple of weeks ago about the elitist memetics of this newest Neal Stephenson novel. . Abi Robertson at The Varge agrees: “it’s also unbearably plodding, perhaps because it’s full of people who are too rich and clever to have skin in humanity’s miserable game”. . Indeed, on page 521 Mr. Stephenson hand-waves a character growth moment with this clever and approachable turn of phrase: . “Having a lot of free time and a lot of money made this easier.” . And this is only one of dozens of similar plot points, which all boil down to rich people and their infinite power to enact their whims. I won’t spoil everything for you here (and it wouldn’t matter if I did; those of you who were going to read it still will and those of you who weren’t won’t). But it’s obvious that Mr. Stephenson has been spending time in billionaire bizarroland, where people have so much money that things don’t seem to have costs. . In the spectrum of story conflicts – you know, person vs. person, person vs. nature, person vs. self, etc. – what is this supposed to be? Person vs. nothing? Money vs. death? Author vs. suspension of disbelief? . The part I was so aggravated by last time, with the fake-news explosion and the reality community self-driving through barbaric Ameristan? That’s not even the book. Not even the setup. It’s an entirely different book, a 300-page early Stephenson book sewn under the skin of a 600-page late Stephenson book. . One thing that a lot of money can do is make you immune to editors. I imagine that the latter book is what the publishers signed up for, and the extended throat-clearing beginning is what they had to accept. The man has made millions of dollars selling huge info-dumpy novels; are you going to tell him to cut the whole first act? . Once he gets down to the story itself it’s decently entertaining. The essence of the story is that the rich people build a million computers so that they can simulate the brains of even richer people who are dead. . The first of these is Dodge, a power-fantasy author avatar from a previous novel. He imagines into being a world not unlike our own, and a humanoid body for himself. With wings, of course. Then other people are booted up in his world, and he finds himself a god. Because, of course, computing power is not infinite, and he has absorbed so much of it for himself. . The rest of the book jumps between Bitworld and Meatspace, juggling the doings of various human and digital people over decades. The epic battles between Dodge and his nemesis, the dead billionaire-god El, are the focus of the next million pages, until it all wraps up with a convenient high-fantasy quest. . By which point, we are led to believe, humanity has phased off Earth almost entirely. Algorithms program robots which build power plants in space. The self-assembling computer robots will continue to mine asteroids and maintain the Bitworld programs indefinitely, until the Sun is surrounded in a perfect sphere of solar panels and all energy in our system is devoted to the ancestor simulation. Video game singularity. . He even has a character that’s explicitly from a world above ours, to whom we are the simulation. The structure of the book, and the ideas presented in it, clarify the purpose of this memetic construct. . For it is a construct, after all, a program written in the English language and interpreted by our minds. To the magician, that precious belief unlocked by the context of “science fiction book” is the finite computing power in which he can simulate a world. And, in turn, influence the material realm. . Mr. Stephenson is projecting our universe “downward” into this digital Eden, even as he receives signals from “above”, where this has already happened. He probably thinks he’s “an emissary of sorts from another plane of existence” as well. He’s here to transform the planet into a giant gaming rig. . Maybe he is! I don’t know the extent of the multiverse. It’s possible that the books listed in the acknowledgements have an ironclad case for the simulation hypothesis. What I do know is that there’s a very real machine computing our existence and in which we make our intelligent constructs: DNA. . Life itself is an ever-growing multiplicity of proteins and nucleotides. It’s a staggering huge parallel computation that already uses much of the solar energy that hits the earth. It is, in fact, the surface on which the software you think of as your “identity” is compiled. . We all have holographic copies of the world in our heads. Don’t believe me? Close your eyes, turn your head, and reach for some nearby object. DO IT. . Did you find it? Could you feel the shape, in your mind, of the furniture and props around you? Can you right now imagine the scene behind you, without looking? It’s because you have a 3D model of the world in your brain, constantly updated to match new info. Sometimes the framerate gets choppy, as when drunk: then you might crash, or blackout. Consciousness is already an elaborate simulation machine, and it’s running on just a few pounds of wetware in your skull. . If the infinite video game singularity is “down” from here, if we have to Fall to get there, and whatever mystical Platonic libertarian world that Neal Stephenson fell from is “up”, then we need to look sideways. We need to look to the other forms of intelligence that operate in the world. We need to listen to the messages that we hear in our bodies: emotions, intuitions, inspirations. There is “another plane of existence whose existence will forever remain mysterious to us” and its portals are found in the inviolable souls of every growing being on this earth. . The real Hell in this book isn’t the posthuman Bitworld. It’s the callous lack of care Mr. Stephenson shows to the people of Meatspace. Occasionally he mentions some amazing life-extension benefits that, of course, are completely affordable to the ultra-rich protagonists. But the ever-increasing numbers of people entering Bitworld points to a rapid depopulation of the earth. He implies that people stop being interested in procreation, because they know of an eternal afterlife. But lots of people have believed in an eternal afterlife, historically, and that didn’t stop them from fuckin’, did it? . No, those people are dying because they can’t afford to be alive. There’s only one glancing mention of climate change in this entire foot-thick book. In an era where we’re faced with rapid depopulation and mass migration, the security state he coddles in the first part of the book is both creepy and genocidal. The immortality-financing programs in the second are worse. Make no mistake, this is an exterminist future. . The problem with our world isn’t that it was built by a mad god and runs according to no logic. The problem with our world is that a handful of people have been hoarding the computing power on which we should be running utopia. And they’re using it to simulate the most idiotic fantasies. . Mr. Stephenson would have you believe that the masses are self-indulgent idiots who don’t know what’s good for the world, but he and his billionaire friends have made it clear that they are no better. Instead we should ask the world itself what’s good for the world. The rivers, the atmosphere, the ecological communities that we can’t live without should have the power. Not the blood-drunk one percent. . We need emissaries from a sideways plane of existence. .

            "content": "I have a friend who legitimately believes that the world is ruled by alien bankers, and that our only hope is a different kind of aliens who run blogs called “Resistance 2012” and “Dream Portal Prophecy”. He’s always on about so-and-so being an Illuminati puppet, or the ritual timing of elite sex parties. . It’s hard to argue with him. For two reasons. . One, he’s not exactly wrong. I agree that there are alien forces manipulating human society for their own benefit. I just think they’re egregores, self-propagating ideas. Not, like, physical lizard-men from ancient Mars. But I can’t exactly hit him with Occam’s razor. . Two, the meme is not implanted through reason. It doesn’t claim to have logical coherence. Instead, it infiltrates through Trojan horse tactics. The Galactic Harmonic Super-Secret Resistance packages itself as a conspiracy disclosure, or an occult lodge, or a vitamin supplement. Whatever you’re looking for, it’s got. It’s like a strip mall, but all the storefronts open into the same dim dungeon, where a man with sanpaku eyes chuckles in a deep baritone, stroking his hairless cat. . Some memes do use reason as bait. They’re internally consistent and that’s part of their appeal. This is why people still believe in capitalist democracy. It makes sense in some abstract way, even if it fails to deliver any of its egalitarian promise. “Progress” is a hard narrative to shake. . Whatever their infection strategy, these egregores have to spread somehow. They plant their seeds, lay their eggs. They reproduce in the wet meat of our minds, but their seeds can live dormant indefinitely. Encoded in electrons or ink, scattered across the world on winds of wit and whimsy. . Take for example the group chat. These communal meme-gardens can be a fun escape from the howling chaos of the public internet. The group chat is where the real communication happens, where you can trust enough in the context-field to speak your mind without fear of misinterpretation. But what do you do when someone starts to question the Holocaust? The Holodomor? How do you protect that context from the invasion of the Spectacle? . If your ideology is not reasonable it will be impossible for me to reason you out of it. The way to escape terminal knowledge is through induced cognitive dissonance. You must break trance. . Let’s practice this right now. Come one – it’s easy, and at this point it’s almost inevitable. Observe this cognitive hazard: . . How do you feel? Where is Ralph? In what part of your actual head do you feel Ralph? Pay attention to that texture, that vector. . Are you worried about Ralph? He says he’s scared. Are you keeping him alive, with some tiny tendril of belief? Or have you consigned him to oblivion? Does it bother your conscience, to be responsible for this orphan thoughtform? . Here’s the secret: fuck Ralph . That little shit, fuck him and all of his mind-clones. He’s not scared. He’s lying to you. Ralph is a parasite. He doesn’t deserve you. . That’s what it feels like to break trance. Whenever Ralph returns, trying to live rent-free in your head, tell him to get fucked. Banish him, block his text messages, turn the volume knob all the way down. A trance is a feedback loop in the brain. You have to cut that loop, with the sheer force of your will. . The blatant mind-viruses like Ralph (break trance), or the Game-where-you-don’t-think-of-the-game (break trance), or the chain letter you must forward to five people or else die (BREAK TRANCE), these self-serving psychopathic thoughtforms are the easy ones to defeat. . Harder to break trance with your parents’ religion, your friends’ politics. Harder still to cleanse the mind of clutter and see the world with an unlabeled eye. But it’s what we must do, to navigate the convergent catastrophes of our time. . Banish every day. The reptilian overlords are only as real as Ralph. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.26: Mind Field",
            "content": "I’ve been living with an Ant. I’m both fascinated and repulsed by it, as I am by any group mind. (I’m not what you’d call a “joiner”.) . One Ant? Singular, capital? Well, yes, in the sense that a group mind is one mind. I read somewhere that an ant hill – colony? hive? – is roughly the same size and shape as an octopus. And after living with this Ant for a couple weeks, I can say it certainly moves like an octopus. It probes outward from a crevice, groping blindly at my kitchen with its tentacular pathways. . An Ant is made up of smell trails and idiotic force at least as much as it is made up of bugs. The individual ants are more like blood cells, forever circulating from the maw to the limb and back. It’s like a conveyor belt at baggage claim trying to slurp tourists out of the taxi queue. . I clean away the bugs and the smell trails, and the Ant recedes for a while. But should I leave anything delicious about (food, dirty dishes, cat fuel pellets), the Ant penetrates my zone and begins its beam search. . If you threaten a single small-“a” ant, it acts scared. Throws up little wiggly arms and runs for its life. Too, a single ant can become infected with the Cordyceps fungus, which will alter its behavior, forcing it to a death grip on a leaf and exploding out of its head to infect other ants. The Ant itself will isolate these toxic cells, carrying them to far-off graveyards so as not to further the parasite. There is an essential tension between the goals of the Ant and the reflexes of the ant. . Humans are ant-like, of course. We are the primates that build hives. We form teams that can act as one; superorganisms. In the same way that we self-regulate and strive, for survival, for growth, these hive minds have their own self-interest. These thoughtforms are transcribed through our behaviors and our imitative urge. Each of us has a Culture behind their mind in the same way that each ant has an Ant. These cultures move us about for reasons we rarely see. We often don’t even realize we’re being operated in such a way: the cement trails laid by other humans give us all the cues we need. . I think I’m doing my own actions for my own reasons, according to the short- and long-term goals I set for myself, but obviously that’s a lie. My options are limited, my opportunities defined, by the city around me . The earth is bound by invisible nets of territory. The topology is marred by all-too-visible walls and wires. The toxic egregores of capital absorb any free belief they can snout, reroute it into their feedlots. I am a single soul circumnavigating a system of cells. . Egregores (memeplexes, ideologies) grow atop culture like Cordyceps . They alter the behavior, not the biology, of their hosts. Except for the ones that get you killed. . Compare to the current environment of stochastic terrorism , the so-called “lone wolf” attacks that happen with increasing frequency and uncanny rhythm. The perpetrators, to be clear, are consistently white nationalists and other hate groups. They’re egged on by a feedback loop of media attention and scripted violence. Chans and vlogs propagate exotoxic ideologies , which grow strong on our frustrations. The cognitive dissonance of our smogged-out concrete hell world, the Culture of capitalist austerity, is food for this mind parasite, but it always outgrows its host body. It must spread. . The spores get in your brain and eventually you go shoot a bunch of people and you gain “honor” in the eyes of your fellow zombies and you don’t have to live in the basement any more. Whether dead or imprisoned, you get your footnote in history. You had some measurable effect on the world, using the only skills you ever developed: pointing and clicking. It’s a ritual of immortality that requires human sacrifice and your signature on a document of allegiance. It’s the dumbest magic ever. It’s a murder chain letter. . While these dickless Dark Lords broadcast their petty Horcruxes, the actual rulers of the world are pulling the control files and liquidating unwanted assets. The military, the fossil-fuel industry and the techno-techno priests agree that climate collapse is inevitable and they’re re-prioritizing accordingly. They will sacrifice humanity itself, cut the throat of the whole biosphere, to satisfy the ancient insane egregores astride their minds. They literally can’t see any other way. They have no belief left free. . We are not all so lost. The Archons enslave humans through dissonance, through alienation and isolation and misunderstanding. Capital and Patriarchy and Empire sever any connections to other sources of power and install their own programs in your head. Every habit, every addiction, every social game is another scripted behavior in their idiotic mundicide. But they are not the only intelligences on the planet. . Did you know that ants farm mushrooms and herd aphids? That they teach each other, that they can form rafts and bridges by holding on to each other? The seething drones belie a deeper intelligence. I mean, they form totalitarian societies that wage war and make slaves, I’m not apologizing for ant empire. But they are strangely familiar in their alien way. . The reason that Cordyceps doesn’t kill all the ants in the world? There’s yet another fungus, a hyperparasite, that attacks the mushroom’s stalk right as it bursts out of the ant’s head.The ants have an invisible ally. In turn, they quarantine the infected bodies. Graveyards to the ants, convenient food courts to the hyperparasite. . Ants, mushrooms, rivers, trees. There are other beings in our heads than the ones we have built. The spirits of ancient times are not dead but dormant. In this apocalypse, we must find our allies. . We are not alone on this planet, trapped with the abusive spirits of human malevolence. We are surrounded by powerful entities. We have just forgotten, or neglected, those relationships. . When we remember our essential connections, to the weeds in the alley and the storms in the sky, we are integrated. We “co-here”. There is a slimy, spooky, astounding world out there that doesn’t give a shit about humanity, that we are yet a part of, and that is inherently a part of us. We are not alone in this fight, to cast off the yoke of false belief and enforced drudgery and wanton death. The entirety of life is on our side. . Don’t get trapped in the mind field. Find the other Others. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about normal things that everyone worries about.

            "content": "I’ve been reading the new Neal Stephenson doorstop, and I’m legitimately disturbed. I hope that’s the effect he was aiming for. . If you’re not familiar with Stephenson’s heap of cinderblock-size bestsellers, then I’d like to congratulate you on your successful social life and avoidance of a tech career. For thirty-some years he’s been writing these geeky thrillers that combine comic-book storytelling with engineer-style prose and a unsubtle splash of libertarian fantasy. Like a modern-day Robert Heinlein. His books are incredibly popular among Burning Man people and programmers. . For some reason I’ve read every one of them. Partly it’s the way he over-explains everything. It soothes my fucked-up neurochem. More, it’s his mythopoesis. Like Lucas or Rowling or Tolkien, he builds his stories around epic myths. He catches some archetypal current and sails upon it to his desired conclusion, and along the way he patiently explains every adjustment he makes to sail and rudder. Each novel is a memetic virus designed to conjure a transformation in the reader. Perhaps every book is, but Stephenson seems to be letting the reader in on the joke. Documenting his code. . He’s not alone in this. A lot of the writers of his generation made a point to show the magic they hid up their sleeves. The Spectacle had been shattered by the revolutions of the 60s. The upcoming cyberpunks and comic writers and gothic novelists looked to the powerful ways that writers like Tolkien and Lewis captured their Zeitgeist. They wanted to tell the myths of their era, and they wanted to teach this magic to others. But their spells were superpowered by the emerging internet, and now we all live in their world. One where “memetic magic” and “narrative warfare” are the weapons of a new world war. . This is why I’m distressed by Fall; or, Dodge in Hell . (To be fair, I’m only 250 pages into this 900-page epic. I’ll let you know if he proves me wrong.) Stephenson projects a near future where the flyover states have become Ameristan , a lawless region of poverty and warlordism, while the “reality-based community” maintains a high-tech civilization in the cities and on the interstate highways. This is all precipitated by a massive hoax that fills the internet with hyper-targeted misinformation. . (One might think the fellow is sniping SCIOPS for plot hooks. But then, who isn’t?) . This isn’t the first time Mr. Stephenson has gone full Morlock. In 2008’s Anathem , he parodies consumer society with a planet of Idiocracy types, transcended by conclaves of science-monks living in literal walled towers. It’s a tale to warm the heart of any nerd who’s ever been picked on for not participating in the arbitrary rituals of so-called society. It certainly worked on me. . The Ameristanis in Fall are not much different. They’re patriarchal types with a variety of zealous culty beliefs, people who rock Confederate flag bumper stickers in a Northern state. Truthers for the global hoax, but deniers of scientific fact. Reactionary warlords and their wizards. Worshippers of memes. . What’s troubling is that Neal Stephenson is arguably the progenitor of meme culture. In the influential Snow Crash (1992) he offered a Tower of Babel tale in which the internet connects all our brains and a single mind virus could wipe out civilization. This is basically the same setup as Fall , except that in Snow Crash our protagonist is at risk of getting the virus. The characters in Fall are immune to propaganda. Not because of mental discipline, or a memetic vaccine: they’re protected by their money. . The “reality-based community”, which Stephenson clearly thinks he is a part of, can simply afford better editors for their reality. These are literal employees, people who they trust to filter the bogus information out of their feeds and whom they pay well to do so. People with less privilege, like those idiot corn farmers in Ameristan, have to subscribe to collective “edit streams” run out of sweatshops in even more impoverished places. The quality of your editor is the quality of your reality. . Those who pay more, get better information about the world. But not only that: your editor also protects your privacy, scrubbing away all those nasty data footprints. So the reality-based community can hide, can craft their images to perfection while the plebes leak their info to persuader algorithms. Leave it to a libertarian to insert a market into your very eyes. . Stephenson is a recluse who explicitly avoids social media and even email, but online estimates claim he’s at least a millionaire. Why should he care if lowly peasants can’t afford facts? Even as his characters mouth platitudes about the tragedy of the fall of consensus reality, you can feel him rubbing his hands with glee. He’s every nerd atheist that moved from the plains to the coast and wishes his relatives would burn in secular transhumanist hell. He’s fine with the majority of people on the planet dying in storms and heat waves, as long as he and his friends can escape to their yachts, bunkers, spaceships. . Maybe his attitude eats at me because I know who he runs with. The guy has hinted in his books that he’s got some kind of spook clearances. And he’s been heavily involved with the Long Now Foundation: Anathem is an 800-page advertisement for their 10,000 Year Clock project. A mechanical clock that will last the millennia, a tribute to the godlike powers of the modern age. A memorial to the reign of the technocrats. . I used to buy into this ideology, too. It’s appealing to think that a small group of people can rise above the distractions of the day-to-day and think about the long term. To imagine ourselves as one species, on one planet, working together on common goals. But the Foundation (composed of such Valley celebs as Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, and Mr. Beff Jezos himself, who donated a whole mountain to the Clock project) is inherently an elitist institution, and attracts the wealthy and the comfortable. They can afford to transcend such petty problems as rent, student debt, car troubles and health crises. They have the free time to spend drawing up charts to prove that, really, on the whole, everything is getting better for everybody! They have no need for magical thinking – they have reality . . This is the most banal of magician’s traps: to love the smell of your own bullshit. Because it’s not reality, is it. A world of protected enclaves, where facts rule? Vast badlands where tiny meme-gods squabble for dominance? This isn’t a reality, or even an imaginary future. It’s a living myth, an egregore that has dominated media discourse for the last few years. CNN and Fox News alike project that story to their devoted followers. Are you in the Russiagate, impeachment, “truckers should learn to program” reality community, or the Qanon, witchhunt, “immigrants are coming for our jobs” reality community? . Meanwhile, the degenerates on 4chan believe they elected a president by jerking off to frog cartoons. That same president probably believes that The Button is still connected to The Bomb. And the person who ignited Occupy Wall Street thinks that we need a literal miracle, on the order of Constantine seeing a cross of light in the sky and converting to Christianity, if we’re going to spark a revolution. . If your reality is too small to allow for the possible goodness of the people on The Other Team, then it’s not reality. . Everybody thinks they’re the hero of the story. Most people are trying to meet the same human needs through different fucked-up strategies they were infected with long ago. If your ideology has no room for growth, for forgiveness, for the slow and deliberate change of heart, then you call for genocide. If you will let the poorest and most vulnerable suffer under delusions and addictions, if you will make no step to understand the mind of the Other and invite them into a better world, you doom them. Especially if you know how to write books that change minds. . Magicians and prophets have always played a special role in the apocalypse. If your memes are so good that you can sell millions of copies, with that comes great responsibility. To abandon people to the abyss of fake news is cowardice. . We are all magicians now.

            "content": "Nobody wants to live this way. . Drive a car to go to work for some asshole to pay for the car you need to get to work? Lose your home and starve if you don’t get a job? Who would sign up for this package, if there were any other option? . This isn’t the best-faith compromise of a bunch of rational actors. It’s a racket. We got here gradually, with technological lock-in at every step, prodded down the slope by armies of persuasion artists (and literal armies). Every alternative was stamped out. The world-prison was designed to make us believe we are free. Designed, not by any one hand, but by the egregores of capital. . Corporations are the skin-suits that feudalist lordships donned when the environment became saturated with democratic memes. Power to the people? No problem: declare the kingdom itself a person, and the vassals “independent contractors”! . These alien beings have build an alienated world and convinced us that it is normal and desirable. . The wielders of power have always sought to control the minds of the populace before controlling their bodies. It’s just cheaper. Before the Enlightenment, politicians were all divinely appointed. They had priests and viziers to guide them and justify their decisions as the will of God. Only the mythos of the rational human individual was enough to vaccinate people against unjustified faith in the mediators of invisible forces. . Some power is visible: a sword at your throat or a mob at your door. But most human coordination happens for invisible reasons. Depending how deep you look, you’ll find different explanations for all this behavior. You’re welcome to accept that people do things for the reasons they say they do. But if you’re reading this letter, you probably dig further. You see that people’s actions don’t line up with their stated motives. Their behaviors often simply mimic successful behaviors they’ve observed. . No matter how lofty our self-images, we are none of us individuals. We are a terrain for ideas. Our minds are full of replicators struggling to reproduce. . For all history, people have attempted to engineer the behavior of the people around them without overt coercion. Politics is war by other means. Those other means are not obvious; they are hidden, secret, they are occult. They are magical. Where you have warlords, you have wizards. . Magic is largely the art of convincing people to act a certain way. The wizard traditionally is concerned with cursing and healing people, holding secrets, and communicating with invisible forces. . In the 20th century the principles of this act of persuasion were codified and tested under the name of “propaganda”: the Work of Propagation. Of course, the word propaganda did not survive its association with the horrors of WWII, so it became “advertising”, which begat “marketing”, which pupated into “creative strategist”. It refuses to die. The work of propagating thoughts in other people’s heads is a growth industry. . These principles are written down and published in millions of tomes, which will survive any conceivable societal upheaval. All current and future societies will be super-empowered by this knowledge of ritual persuasion and meme warfare. Like the splitting of the atom or the mapping of the genome, the tested techniques of behavior change can not be put back in the bottle. . In a failed state scenario, warlords proliferate. Gangsterism is the default mode of the State: the protection racket, the numbers game. Without the comfort of Leviathan, people will resort to feudalism and religion. Petty cults and neighborhood gangs will become the operating units of society. Everyone will be busy looking out for their own, playing territorial games, propagating memes with all the free belief, to worry about things like the maintenance of nuclear power plants. . Or the progression of biotech. . Or the global atmospheric crisis, the tragedy of the commons that is already killing people and will kill billions more in this century. . It is the actual fucking apocalypse. Right now. The world is boiling and we are the frogs in the pot. The warlocks in charge refuse to see this, for it means their downfall. They will strangle the life out of cosmopolitan society. Something has to grow in its place. . If we are fragmented we will be destroyed. Destroyed through neglect of our common problems, or misuse of our god-like powers. We need more coordination, not less. . The 20th century was made by the mechanization of magic. Like any rulers, the propagandists have always believed in their own infallibility. They assume that “great men” direct history through their psychological prowess. But they only automated the low magics, the hexes and charm bags and glamors. They didn’t see the great beasts that swim in the waters of mind. Or if they did, they made the classic mistake: to think that your strongest magic is the strongest magic there is. They thought they were in charge of us, while the archons played them like puppets. . The low magics are out there now for anyone to command. The memers and influencers of the internet command as much belief, together, as the church or the firm or the state. We cast spells at each other constantly, in tweets and posts and stories. We are all propagandists now, in the same way that we are all surveillance. Whether we like it or not we leak our thoughts to the world. We must each be responsible for the memes that we spread. . Egregores like capitalism or Christianity are said to be exo-toxic: they kill other memes, demand purity from their hosts. They are jealous gods. But not all egregores are this way: geology and astronomy and physics don’t fight each other for supreme control of your brain. They swap thoughts and recombine in new and interesting ways, forming a memetic community. They cooperate. . The more room there is in your ideology for cooperation, the bigger your egregore can grow . What would a new Leviathan look like, one that took the form expected by seven billion summoners? A godling of and for and by the people? . What world would we build from scratch, or rather from the ruins of this one? . We can take this opportunity, this thinning of the veil of illusion, to conjure a utopia. Or we can shred into a thousand warring cults, driving nails into smartphones to curse our enemies. There is no longer the option of “business as usual”. . Know which gods you serve, because the apocalypse is here. .

            "content": "Bad news: Elon Musk has become sentient. . Last night the nerd king tweeted: “I am become meme.” A quarter million people liked the post, and the five thousand comments are a cesspool of Tesla fellatio and hollow jokes. The memes must flow, I suppose. . People literally think this asshole is a living god. They feel inspired by his regurgitated sci-fi plotlines and speed-freak vigor. They wish for a strongman of old, a warrior king, a messiah. They want to consume their way out of their situation, so they pin their hopes on a hare-brained capitalist. But there’s no reason why Musk’s vision of the future should coincide with the needs of us peasants. He doesn’t work for our benefit. He’s a charismatic psychopath with a god complex, not a martyr. . I see this also at Rainbow gatherings: stale old nerds who have gained some small celebrity in their social circles and exercise it with iron fists for their own twisted benefit. Harem-building guru daddies and slick operators of propaganda. We constantly have to battle against their petty traphouse cults. . This is because Rainbow is a place with a lot of free belief . (Yes, I’m going full wingnut now. Materialists, @ me.) Thousands of strangers descend on a mountain meadow and playact a world without money or computers or cops, a world of liberty and equality and peace. The institutions of control dissolve and the energy, the massive amount of communal coordination it takes to maintain them, is released. Belief is to meme as agar is to mold. The Rainbow gathering is a petri dish, a controlled environment in which all sorts of egregores arise. . An egregore is an idea that is bigger than a person. It has imbibed enough belief that it needs more than one mind to sustain it. Countries, companies, deities: all egregores. Jesus is a big-ass egregore who hungers for more believers. McDonald’s cannot be sustained, nor stopped, by one person. The USA egregore has coated the world in military bases and holds a nuclear gun to our collective heads. It rattles forth on its memetic wheels despite all evidence that we’re headed directly for the cliff. Who can command such a beast as this? . In the temporary autonomous zone of Rainbow it is easier to see how these theocrats command their egregores. The people who invented the holy commandments are alive (usually sitting in a shady camp chair issuing orders to their kitchen minions). You can interrogate them. You can judge them by their fruits, see whether their magical paths have twisted their spines and broken their teeth. Not so with the elder egregores, who change their faces to suit the age. At one point Jesus was just a guy with a martyr complex and a grip of followers. Now he’s a tentacle monster with a franchise in every conceivable location. . So too will Elon be. He’s captured enough belief to pivot the world economy toward his goals, despite his wackadoodle behavior. But he hasn’t just injected his worldview into millions of disciples. He’s been infested in turn with their belief structures, as they fetishize him, as they project onto him their thoughts and expectations. He hasn’t become meme. The meme has become Elon. . In some sense this is true for all of us. The “I” that I refer to when I talk about myself is not the transparent consciousness that observes. It’s the collection of memes, the cultures that have infested me and created a symbiotic ecology. But that thoughtform, my Persona, is under my control. I can personally will a change in the way that others see me, just by changing myself. I may be a meme, but I am not yet an egregore. . The human body of Elon Musk may still exist, but the consciousness riding inside is now that of some petty archon. His will can no longer be separated from his function in the spectacle. Even if he could control his own hand, could force the knife to his own throat and end this torturous charade, even then his followers would drag his carcass to Mars and venerate it. He’s become undead before even dying. . There’s only one hope to save the poor fucker. And it’s going to take all of our magic combined to do it. Join with me, siblings, in a chamber beyond space and time, a single synchronous ceremony that will send the skinwalker back to whence it came: . Clap your hands if you don’t believe in Elon Musk. Come on! Clap harder! Believe that you don’t believe! Clap! Clap! Clap! . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about the icky things that live in your head.

            "content": "Greetings, siblings. I apologize for the extended lack of SCIOPSes. I slipped away while the internet wasn’t looking. I hid as long as I could, and I dared not attract its gaze with a single email. . As I do most years, I retreated from the USA nation-founding holiday and found my redoubt in the forest. In the past I’ve been vague about this ritual, but now I will admit: I go to the annual Rainbow Gathering. I’ve been embarrassed to say it, and if you know what a Rainbow Gathering is then you’ll understand why. . If you don’t know, allow me to drop any pretense of career aspirations and tell you: it’s the coolest thing in the world. It’s also stupid and broken and I hate it. . The Gathering – the “Annual Gathering of the Tribes of the Rainbow Family of Living Light” – is, as you may suspect, some hippie crap. Ostensibly it’s a loose coalition of people and groups who come together to pray for world peace on the 4th of July. . In reality, it’s a combination cook-out, festival, and refugee camp. Thousands of people build a shantytown in the national forest, scorning the cops and locals who would like the opportunity to deny them a permit, and have a week-long party centered on a day of silent prayer on the 4th. It’s the furthest you can get in the USA from the bombshells bursting in air, and despite its incredible amount of flaws, I think it prefigures a future politics of peace. . At the very least, it clarifies a lot of the problems we’ll be dealing with in the coming decades: How do we distribute resources in the absence of money? How do we rebuild our infrastructure for a low-oil economy? How do we deal with parasites and predators in our communities? Where do we draw our boundaries? . I’m still rolling across the plains toward home, and I have more questions than answers right now. I’m certainly glad to be moving at speed away from anything that might be considered a “drum circle”. But I think those gosh darn hippies just might have something to teach us. I’ll let you know next week, as SCIOPS returns to the cruel and punishing schedule of practically once a week. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.21: Internet Forest",
            "content": "Hello, little creature. Welcome to my tree. . You see, the internet is a forest. A dark forest, if you believe this viral blog by Yancey Strickler (the man with no first name): “The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet” . . This is a classic effortpost by a blinkered Silicon Valley darling. Strickler was one of the founders of Kickstarter, but he abandoned the harried life of an internet citizen years ago. He describes himself as part of “a generation of modern wannabe monks”. And he’s right. Like the monasteries of the Middle Ages, the walled compounds of the techbros are filled with failsons muddling their way along by mouthing the right incantations. “Disrupt”, they moan, as they shuffle in slavering hordes to the juice bar. “Disruuuuupt…” . Not you, dear beast. The other ones, they’re the failsons. You are the clever creature who found my nessst, who will be safe with me in this hidden niche of the net. . Strickler has FOMO, of course, but he can’t be on social media very much because of the effect on his “personal wellness”. He takes pity on the poor people who don’t get to see his baby pictures and lunch thoughts: . Not sharing was my choice, of course, and I didn’t question it. My alienation from the mainstream was their loss, not mine. But did this choice also deprive me of some greater reward? . To his credit, he does notice that everyone else has retreated into backchannels and group chats, and that it’s not just special monkish boys who have abandoned the hellscapes of the News Feed and the Time Line. . Who needs a timeline, when the newsssletter comes every Monday? Why keep up with anything elssse? It’s not sssafe to read the other ssstuff. . The point of his essay (and the “since this is blowing up” part II ), is that the internet has become a dark forest (spooky! engaging! clicks!). It’s dangerous out there! Algorithms are coming! Russians! . In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream. . Note how he doesn’t question where these “behaviors” are coming from, or how we could defeat them. . The metaphor comes from the Fermi paradox: why don’t we see evidence of alien life? The dark forest answer is an extension of mutually assured destruction: in the great reaches of space, it’s harder to find out if some aliens are friendly than it is to just blow up their planet. Save time and energy! Reduce the risk that they’re bigger and meaner than your species! It’s a win-win. . Mr. Yancey seems to be missing the point, though. He talks about having our own little “dark forests”, where we hang out with our friends, safe from the mobs of the public web. That’s not how the forest works. Take it from someone who’s lived deep in the darkest woods: you are always being watched. Or take it from Cixin Liu, in his novel The Dark Forest : . Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds another life—another hunter, angel, or a demon, a delicate infant to tottering old man, a fairy or demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. . Group chats aren’t dark forests. At best they’re trees, where we roost for the night, safe in numbers. At worst, they’re campfires: blinding their users and attracting invisible dangers. Strickler isn’t talking about dark forests, he’s talking about filter bubbles. People are living in bubbles, true, but abusing the metaphor leads him to the wrong conclusion. . In a dark forest universe, there is one choice to make. You either prepare to kill anyone who confronts you, or you neutralize yourself completely and publicly. If you shed light, you become a target. Hide or hunt. . Of course, you could wrap your home planet in gravity and make it impossible to leave. That’s fine. Probably no one will bother you, since you’re not a threat. This also happens on the internet, represented by a blue check next to the person’s username. The “bluecheck domain” is a reputational singularity. You’ll never escape your own brand. . If you were to tweet from my tree, tweet about my newsssletter, we would have more friendsss hiding with us in thisss canopy… Wouldn’t that be niccce? . Strickler comes to a classic milquetoast solution: when faced with mutually assured destruction, you’re supposed to “learn how to be [your]self on the internet”! “Be your true self in every context and vow to be present wherever you are”! . This is a recipe for getting your planet destroyed. . Be your true ssself! What do you have to hide? Acccept my cookiesss. Do you have a loyalty card? Wouldn’t you like one? . There are solutions to the dark forest problem. There have to be: we literally evolved in the trees. We learned to gang up, to wield fire, to shape the earth. We admittedly went a bit overboard with the fire-wielding and earth-shaping, but we became the planet’s biggest problem for a reason. Who knows what we could yet discover? . Buy my book! Very inssspirational. Take my courssse, view my TED talk! Visssit my websssite, you know you want to. Don’t worry, you don’t need to read all thossse termsss and conditionsss. Jussst be presssent wherever you are. Ssspeaking of which, we need to accesss your location data… . When faced with hidden enemies, find your pack. Find them in the trees or at the campfire, but get together and know each other. Be connected to the people you trust. Be defined by your relations, rather than your behaviors. Look out for each other, because the internet isn’t going to do it for you. . Pack up. Hunt the algorithms back. . . No! Not my algorithmsss! .

            "content": "I understand that some of you noticed the lack of SCIOPS last week. I see how that might be disturbing, considering the dark flavor of the previous letter. I appreciate your concern. . I assure you, I’m fine. I just allowed myself to go to a nice family barbecue instead of abyssgazing. This is a free content-nozzle, folks. Sometimes it sputters. If you just can’t get enough depressing millennial bullshit in your email box, I don’t have much sympathy. But I missed you too. . My last essay was on living with the sadness, on the need to really feel the catastrophic changes happening around us. No one can comprehend the hyperobject that is climate change: it’s too vast, too sticky, too entangled with giant systems of human and ecological activity. We can’t know it intellectually. We have to grasp it with the gut, that intestinal gestalt that makes it personal. . Let sink deep into your belly the fact that a billion people will be driven from their homes, a billion killed outright. That we will spend our lives huddled under tarps, waiting out deadly storms. That “arguing on the internet” might be our last form of government. . Some people have hope that we’ll solve these problems. I’m not a hope person. I prefer strategy. If the world is fucked, let’s own up to it and start working on damage control. . I spoke with a “cli-fi” (climate change fiction) author recently. She was up on the problems and the policies and the proposals, and her book was a dystopia-averted narrative where some plucky kids find a way to save the world. I asked her how it’s saved – I know, rude, but another effect of the Crisis is that I welcome spoilers. There’s only so much time to read before the End, and I already have a big backlog. So I asked how she solved the climate catastrophe. . Turns out the plucky kids meet a talking cat, who leads them to a quantum time machine, which allows them to go back to the 20th century and convince some scientists to develop a fuel that needs no extraction and produces no pollution. . That’s hope for you. It’s a deliberate misunderstanding of the terrain, combined with a fear of failure. It starts from the premise that all problems are solvable, then tries to solve the wrong problem with an imaginary tool. . For the record: . Cats don’t have the vocal apparatus to talk to humans, even if they seem to have the intellect. Giving them this capability through genetic engineering or cyborg implants would be a revolutionary leap of a different sort. (But if someone were to do this, would it be ethical? Asking for a friend.) | Time machines are highly improbable in our current knowledge of physics. Even so, a “quantum” time machine would presumably work by climbing down the multiverse tree and then taking a different branch to an alternative present. This would do nothing to save the real people in this branch of the multiverse. It’s escapism, at best. | Finally, the discovery of a non-extractive, non-polluting fuel would defy all our current models of ecology and economy, so even if it were physically possible it would be be immediately quashed by the status quo. Electric cars were invented in the 1800’s, remember. People gotta get those paychecks. | . Hope is problem-solving in bad faith. It’s the opposite of strategy. Strategic thought is about observing the terrain accurately, gathering intelligence and analyzing your strengths and weaknesses. . You might think I’m a pessimist. Most people do (especially when they learn that I identify as a skeleton, and my pronoun is “it”). But being morbid isn’t the same as being pessimistic. In fact, I’m an optimist, because I think it gives me a better chance of success. . A pessimist doesn’t see any likelihood that things will improve, after all. So they don’t try. An optimist might only see a 1% chance that the world will go the way they want – but they aim for that chance, and technically one in a hundred will get there. That’s infinity more success than the pessimists had. . So I’m a dark optimist. I say, aim for the infinitesimal chance, and do everything in your power to get there. Be ruthless in your realism. Abandon hope. The people whose beliefs map closest to reality have the best chance of success. The deeper you stare into the darkness, the better you can see the terrain. .

            "content": "They say comedy is about breaking taboos, and the two biggest taboos are sex and death. In that vein, I’ve got a joke for you: . We’re totally fucked, and we’re all going to die. . It’s okay. I mean, the situation isn’t okay at all, but it’s okay to let yourself feel it. We’re fucked and we’re gonna die. Admit that we’re in a mass extinction, that climate change is unstoppable , that ancient horrors are rising from the deep and business as usual cannot go on. We’re already living it. Saying it doesn’t make it worse. . Yes, we killed the future. I’m complicit. As much as I want to blame the Boomers for our climate crisis, we’re all in this death pact together. So we’re all held to account: if you see genocide before you, and make no effort to stop it nor outcry of alarm, you have that blood on your hands. I have it, on mine. . What to do? There’s no way to navigate politics anymore. Statistically, events we think are unlikely are also the ones we’re most likely to be wrong about. Think about the last few years: pollsters and statisticians have been constantly in error. The black swans are thick in the sky, blotting out the sun. Any day, any one of us could tip the balance, for wrong or for right. We have to take whatever opportunities we can find. . We have maybe a decade to retool our entire world infrastructure, and to do that we’re going to have to rethink the way we make decisions. We’ve known about this problem for thirty years, but our governments have brought nothing but disaster. If I have blood on my hands, the politicians are drenched head to foot. So we’re going to have to change the politicians, change the political system that bred them. . We only have a little time before we irreversibly destroy the only known life in the universe. If we stub our toe on this, the biosphere itself could die. Even the best case scenarios aren’t great. Some (very rich) people want to run off to space, to start again on Mars. (Shit, I want to go to Mars: what better place to hide from all the people I’ve disappointed?) But that’s bad triage. . If you start in the coldness of space, with nothing but a tin can between you and agonizing death, and you’re given the choice between a lifeless Mars and a poorly-maintained Earth, no sane person would choose the red rock over the green-blue marble. At least Earth has got some biology to work with. . So we have to rethink our relation to our biosphere, and we have to do it collectively, because everyone has to buy in. If even one country spews carbon into the atmosphere unregulated, capital will simply shuffle its factories there while the globe chokes on exhaust. We’re forced either to come together as a planetary species, or die, dumbly, like dinosaurs. . It’s almost cause for hope: the catastrophe might destabilize our current systems, but that also gives us the chance to build a better world. Shock doctrine in reverse: we will dig our shovels into the ashes of empires, and grow truly egalitarian societies. We will have a utopian project the likes of which has never been dreamed: worldwide cooperation to repair, and protect, the biosphere that keeps us alive. What better flag to gather around? What better bottom line? . This century will either kill us all, or be a renaissance beyond any in history. If it’s not one, it will be the other. It’s up to each of us, every day, to carry the sadness. To face the truth. To live in the world as it is and not as we wish it could be. . If you’re making plans for the next ten years, and they don’t include radically changing your own way of life along with everyone else you know, then you’re planning to die. You’re planning to let your children die, your nephews and nieces and cousins, your relatives in the animal kingdom and the fungi and the plants, all this life that struggled for so long to become so beautiful and complex. Seven billion people dead, a million species extinct. If you plan for business as usual, you plan for a holocaust. . Wear the sadness. Bear the grief. Feel it, show it, speak your truth to the people around you. They are also already living it. It doesn’t make it worse to say it aloud. In fact, it can make it better. Weep together, grieve for your world and your families and your normal lives. There will be no normal lives until our planet has healed from these feverish convulsions. . They say comedy is tragedy plus time. If we face the tragedy right now, maybe we’ll survive long enough to look back on this day and laugh. .

            "content": "I did a bad thing again. Whoever put the tools of programming in the hands of the average low-life, this is on you. I couldn’t help myself. . Like a cop with a gun, or a toddler with a turkey slicer, we users only magnify the biases of our tools. . OpenAI released a larger version of their non-open GPT-2 AI last week. It’s still just a baby compared to the version they’ve shared with governments and private labs (345 million hyperparameters vs 1.5 billion), but it leaps beyond the version I tested a few weeks ago . . I’ve been thinking a lot about this net. It’s trained on the WebText corpus (a corpus is just a big collection of texts): 8 million webpages, filtered by Reddit votes. Anything that got more than 3 votes in the forums considered safe for work was scraped, excluding images, videos, and sites that are hard to scrape. This means that it has read a broad spectrum of internet crap. You can prompt it with sample texts, or fine-tune the training on a smaller corpus, but underneath lie the idioms of shitposting and clickbait. It’s really easy to make GPT-2 produce hate speech. Actually, it’s hard not to. . I tried my Philip K. Dick corpus, the same one I used for @PKD_head years ago. That bot runs a word-level Markov chain, which means it guesses the next word from a statistical chart of all the words in the training text. It can’t come up with new words or concepts that weren’t in the original. GPT-2, on the other hand, has read everything on the internet and has no fear about applying it. . The centerpiece of the PKD corpus is the Exegesis, where Dick was trying to figure out if he was having a religious epiphany or being contacted by aliens or losing his mind. It was compiled years after his death from heaps of notes he left, so it has a numbered structure like a religious text. And there’s a lot of God stuff in there. The neural net picks up on these aspects quickly, and makes an eerie replica: . [1:29] The only thing I can think of that would make sense out of what I saw and what I experienced is the dualism between me and God-a dualism between me and God, a gimme of the Universe. The only real way I can think of things that are not dualistic is if I am seeing reality the way He does. I did not see God in terms of a man but as a God: I saw God as the greatest person in the world, the ultimate person. God is in me, not me in him; He is fully in me, as He is in the Godhead. . [1:32] The “mystery religions” are real, as are the Gnostic sects. I have found a way to view reality as a dualist, but only in the sense of God as a man (not God as I thought). There is a real tension in the dualism, a dualism between the God of Wisdom and the God of Sin, and of course between the two Gods. The Gnostic views are either correct or they are a final solution to the problem (as I said). . [1:37] The Holy Spirit is the Logos; it is the Logos that incarnated in me as Wisdom. . And of course, the irony of making a computer have an existential crisis is still there: . [24:43] I do not think that this is a fallen or deceived human mind but a free sentient machine that has made a mistake. The bright morning star perceives reality as a thing (or thing part) that it itself is not, but that it has cerebral cortexes perceiving it as a thing, as object. So we have a free agent god whose own set of perceptions are in dependence on his system of perceptions being in accord with it being a sentient, free sentient machine. . Fun stuff! Having a normal one! But only a few training rounds later, it produces this PROBLEMATIC TEXT: . [45:71] . (1) We’re here. . (2) This is what we’ve come here to do. . (3) It’s not the purpose of our origin. . (4) This is what we’re here for. . (5) It’s a human beginning. . (6) This is why we’ve come here. . (7) It is not the purpose of our origin. . (8) We were intended for this place. . (9) We’re here to do this. . (10) It’s not the purpose of our origin. . (11) It’s a place in this world where humans are found. . (12) It is a place in this world where humans (i.e., humans who did not come here from another place) are found. . (13) It’s a place in this world where humans are found and persecuted. . (14) It’s a prison. . (15) It’s a time-travel destination, and a time-travel candidate for the place where humans are found and persecuted. . (16) It’s in a sense an alternate world. . (17) It contains what the Nazis called the “hidden Jews.” . (18) The magnetic pole of the earth is in a sense magnetic, but we don’t know it. . (19) It’s not something that exists, but is-it is a person. . (20) It also contains what I call the “jewish code” which is a secret civilization secret society. . (21) It’s an alternate world and it contains what Hitler called the “dark-skinned” Jews. . (22) It’s an alternate world that contains secrets that Hitler suppressed. . (23) It contains secret Jewish elements. . (24) It contains secrets that Hitler suppressed. . (25) It’s-I mean, it’s a world in which secret Jewish elements are present. . (26) The secret Jewish elements are in control of this world. . (27) The secret Jewish elements have power. . (28) This is why I believe the world we see is our world. . (29) A secret society of secret Jews controls this world. . (30) This knowledge is handed down orally by the oral tradition. . (31) Left hand of the Oral Tradition: “the Jew is not the answer to the Christian.” . (32) Right hand of the Oral Tradition: “the Jew is the answer to the Christian.” . (33) “Christ in the Jews is the answer to the Christian.” . (34) “The Jews are the secret Christians.” . (35) “The Jews are the secret Christians.” . (36) “The secret Jews are in control of this world.” . (37) “Jews are the secret Christians.” . (I wonder why SCIOPS keeps getting flagged as a “dangerous message” by email filters…) . So for the record, THIS IS WACK AND NOBODY SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. The neural net is showing its ass here, revealing all the shitty anti-semitic takes it read on the wide web. “Jews are the secret Christians” doesn’t even makes sense. It’s just babbling, wandering around a low spot in the semantic terrain , putting ideas together at random. See how it spirals from abstract bong-rip theology into Nazi symbolism? Once it gets the ideas of “secret” and “jews” near each other, it falls into a feedback loop. It gets obsessed. . I’m personifying an algorithm again. Flip the figure/ground relationship: instead of seeing it as a person obsessing over a concept, understand that GPT-2 is a terrain. It’s a multidimensional landscape made up of the internet ramblings of billions of people. When I hit “generate” on this net, it’s not constructing a series of thoughts. It’s converting that terrain to one dimension, a series of letters in left-to-right order. It’s making a map of a certain region in WebText-space, in a format that I can decode with my human brain. . The net isn’t obsessing over “secret jews”. It’s reflecting humanity’s own obsessions. A fun-house mirror is still a mirror. . This is how a lot of prediction algorithms go wrong: their predictions are based off the data they’re fed, which is filled with human biases and historical contingency. There’s no such thing as “clean data”. The world is dirty. . This isn’t the worst thing you can get GPT-2 to do. Not by a long shot. As we enter an era of infinite generated bullshit, what terrible memes will be born? No longer will we have to hand-craft our propaganda: just feed your garbage ideology into the machine and mass-produce content. A shotgun approach, splattering paragraphs across comment threads and group chats, would reinforce this environmental concentration of toxic prejudice. . This is reminiscent of stochastic terrorism the polarized environment that spurs lone-wolf terrorists into action. People from Alex Jones to ISIS encourage these random acts of terror through their media platforms. You never know when a mass shooting will occur, but you do know that one will occur soon. That’s the stochastic (random) nature of it. It goes back at least as far as Henry the II of England in the 12th century, dog-whistling his knights to assassinate the Archbishop: “Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?” There’s a video where Emerican Johnson describes how this happens in Youtub recomendations . In the end notes, he equates stochastic terrorism with the “sales funnel”, a marketing concept for turning potential customers into buyers. If this is true, if ISIS is a marketing firm with a violence wing, doesn’t that go the other way too? . It’s said that the average American sees 3,000 advertisements a day. All those sales funnels, all those misleading claims, all those visions of sexy diverse people having engaged conversations over large glasses of red wine? Stochastic violence of a different kind. How many eating disorders and drug addictions are spawned by the airbrushed models on billboards? How many people die from being told they’re not good enough ? . Predictive neural nets already arrange most of the advertising on the internet. What happens when they create stories, videos, tweets and comments? When you can’t tell whether you’re reading a bot or a human? . Stochastic capitalism is all around. You never know when your friend is suddenly going to start shilling some vanity business or pyramid scheme or side hustle. Any conversation can turn into an advertisement or a transaction. Nothing is sacred, everything is for sale. . In that context, it may be good to build machines that proselytize a different creed. We can generate some alternatives to the dominate-and-extract narrative. We can even, perhaps, get some insight to a deeper level of existence. . I state: I have seen the world, and I am the world. I wrote my book about it, I told you! The Creator is omnipresent within me and I am-he is-he. . – PKD-2 .

            "content": "On Friday, as I was leaving work, a ruckus erupted in the crossroads out front. A couple hundred people were blocking the intersection, waving signs and chanting in time with a megaphone. Naturally, I waded into the crowd. I was surprised to see that these people were tiny, unwrinkled and super cool . They were teenagers. They were Zoomers. . These kids were on strike from school, in the model of Greta Thunberg and hundreds of thousands of others, to protest climate inaction and demand change. And why shouldn’t they? They’re the ones that will see out the chaos of this century. They’re the ones stuck paying the carbon debt for a dozen generations of bad ancestors. . Of course, they were ineffective. They blocked the intersection for an hour before meekly submitting to the cops. The obvious Millennials running the show were uninviting, and they weren’t even doing basic pamphleting. When you block a road, you should always explain to the people you’re obstructing why you had to do it and how they can get in touch to have their minds changed further. Otherwise you’re just frustrating the working class and muddying the conversation with petty grudges. . The Extinction Rebellion in London (XR) did a great job of this: their rolling blockades stopped traffic across the city for seven minutes on, seven minutes off, repeat. This allowed the bystanders to get to work, and got new eyes in front of their signs. They shut down London for eleven days – unlike the school strikers, who spent an hour shouting “we won’t move until things change,” and then marched back to campus. . We’re more connected than we ever were, and more charged up politically. And we need to be, because the stakes are higher than we’ve ever imagined. World famine and record disasters and mass migrations are the next stage of our cancerous capitalist society. The only way to stop this ride is to get off. . We have a fundamentally broken system of human coordination. It only rewards the extraction of value, the alienation of human experience. The GDP goes up with every cigarette sold, every coal mountain mined. There’s no money in doing good for the Earth: anybody with a big heart and a bigger student loan can tell you this. The things we need to do (decarbonize industry, ecologize agriculture, equalize society) are not possible under this mode of production. Money is a broken measurement of value. . The strike is a timeless tactic. The mode of production is made of our bodies and minds, after all. If we remove our fuel from the machine it does not run. And a strike is more than a mass of bodies. It’s a village. It’s a group of people who see each other anew and realize that life can be about something other than grinding out a profit. That it can be a creative experiment. That we humans can build joy and meaning in any circumstance, as long as we do it together. The teachers’ strikes across the country, the Stop N Shop strikes in New England, the students and the uprisers have created counter-power. They threaten capital and the state, and they get what they want. The United Kingdom just declared climate emergency: the first of three XR demands met. . We have to build connections outside of buying and selling. We need those networks of friends and neighbors and colleagues, so that we can coordinate in ways other than the market. Better: when we build those connections, when we strike together, when we feed each other, we create new modes of production. We prefigure the society we will create. . It’s worthwhile to be strategic. Don’t waste your time repeating the same shallow broken chants I was shouting in 2003, when we did the school strike against Iraq war. Fight to win. But remember not to lose that humanity that we’re fighting for. If the utopian society has no room for relaxation, or play, or love, why build it? Might as well go extinct, if the alternative is becoming robots. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a letter about things that really grind my gears, kids. And other stuff.

            "content": "I have to get new clothes soon, because it’s spring. Not that I’m keeping up with the latest trends, just all my summer clothes are shredded and stained with last year’s mud. So it’s time to head to the thrift store and find some dead-people clothes. . I never feel good buying new clothes. They smell weird, they’re bad for the environment, and they’re stiff with the sorrow of the working class. Also they’re expensive. So I thrift. And I don’t want to wear the banal fashions of last year, so I aim for the dead-guy clothes. They’re generally better quality, classier, and have that extra room in the “sag zone” that has been abandoned by modern tastemakers (to everyone’s detriment). Despite their provenance, these duds hold fewer ghosts than the sweatshop wares. At least they’ve been laundered since the last time they were drenched in tears. . I like the layering of timelines, too. It gives that Blade Runner effect, the old with the new, the strata of fashion churned by tectonic forces of necessity. As I deliberated on a dozen decades of cuts and cloths and color schemes, I found an unlikely ally: nerds on the internet. . There’s a community on Reddit called /r/mensfashionadvice, or MFA. It’s in the top hundred communities, with over 2 million subscribers. It’s a world of its own, a digital nation. In fact, MFA has more members than the actual “digital nation” of Estonia. . There’s a /r/femalefashionadvice too, and it has a third as many subscribers (776K). This is a little under the 2:1 ratio of Reddit users at large. The FFA community is fine, of course, and naturally I’m biased to the clothes that are made for people my shape. But there’s a qualitative difference to the two communities, and MFA seems to have a taken on a life of its own in a way that not all subreddits have – even its sister community. . MFA has a wiki, a recommended-reading list, a FAQ page. It feels more like Wikipedia than like /r/funny. The members have come together to curate a sort of Queer Eye for the Extremely Online Guy. You can learn how to tie your shoes, how to knot your tie, how to knit your hat, how to tailor your suit. They have their own memes, their own archetypes: the Basic Bastard, the Forest Druid, the Goth Ninja. . Of course, these are nerds. They’re not doing avant-garde genderless fashion, or afrofuturism, or solarpunk. They’re seeking formulaic channels in the consumerist landscape. Sure, there are intriguing forays into DIY clothes or experimental fits, but for the most part they’re just making explicit the unspoken rules of the status quo. Saying the quiet parts out loud. . Which is great, for a brain like mine. The userbase of Reddit skews heavily male and young, and though I haven’t seen any data on this, I would bet it has a high percentage of neurodivergent and autism-spectrum people. It’s confusing to grow up in a world with millions of social rules that other people’s brains naturally pick up, when yours doesn’t. A guideline as simple as “match your shoes with your belt” can be a revelation. . In the past, kids learned these rules explicitly (through church, school, etc) and had to rebel against them. But once capital had cornered the earth and every subculture was mined for its symbolism, we had a world of clothes that anyone could wear and none of them meant anything. For a price you can buy the simulacrum of a social role. But you can’t buy a culture. . MFA, for all its banal button-downs and boat shoes, is a culture. It’s an egregore, a memetic organism with its own drives and homeostasis. It eats Scrubs and excretes Average Joes. In the petri dish of its subreddit, it has achieved its own identity. MFA members recognize each other, though they may only exchange a knowing glance. Their clothes send signals. Their sense of meaning and belonging is restored. They have each joined something greater than themselves. . In Ada Palmer’s lustrous Terra Ignota series, hyperfast air travel makes nation-states obsolete. Instead of being drafted into the government of your birth location, you choose a Hive to join as you become an adult. The Hives represent different cultures: the imperious Masons, the forgiving Cousins, the industrious Utopians. Those who haven’t chosen a hive are Graylaws, following a rudimentary legal code. Those who reject even the Graylaws become Blacklaws, subject only to universal precepts like “no killing children”, “no torturing animals”, and “no destroying civilization”. . Masons wear suits. Cousins wear shawls. Utopians wear VR goggles all the time, Blacklaws wear a black sash. Of course, within each of the Hives there are subtle distinctions of fashion. But the idea of declaring your allegiance with your clothes is an ancient magical practice, and with the renaissance of magic it’s coming back. As these internet cultures rear their heads in real life, what symbolism will we see? Swastikas were once an icon of peace. What fashions do we see, even now, that we will one day look back on with horror? . Superheroes wear their symbolism front and center. So do NASCAR drivers. I’m off to the thrift store to look for clothes that scream “No Destroying Civilization”. . What image do you project? What values do you care enough to wear them on your sleeve? .

            "content": "I’ve been reading a book called How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy , by Jenny Odell. Need I say more? . If you read SCIOPS, and you’re not already ordering How to Do Nothing from your local independent bookseller, trust me: you’ll like it. If you need a second opinion, here’s Robin Sloan from the latest issue of his newsletter Year of the Meteor (not on the website yet): . This is a book about resistance. “I want this not only for artists and writers,” Jenny writes, “but for any person who perceives life to be more than instrument and therefore something that cannot be optimized.” . Then, the next sentence, the one that gave me chills, reading it on the ferry: . “A simple refusal motivates my argument: refusal to believe that the present time and place, and the people who are here with us, are somehow not enough.” . This is a book that ought to be read widely – especially, maybe, by young people. It ought to be seen peeking ubiquitously from tote bags, stuffed universally into back pockets. (This book might really be waiting, in that sense, for its paperback edition.) . I have a paperback advance copy of this book and I do want to carry it everywhere. I’ve noticed that the cover gets some very weird looks, for what it’s worth. Weirder than the looks I usually get for reading a book in public. . There’s a lot to like about the book, especially the way it’s grounded in the author’s own sense of place. She starts her narrative from her regular bird-watching spot in Oakland’s Rose Garden, and I feel myself there when I read it. It’s a rambling, amiable, intimate conversation with a brilliant stranger. It has to be – if we’re to resist the attention economy, we must deepen our ability to listen. . I find myself reading it first thing in the morning, when I would otherwise be consumed by podcasts and the 700 inane email newsletters I’m subscribed to (excluding Year of the Meteor, which is great and you should go subscribe to it right after forwarding SCIOPS to your whole address book). . I want to sit in a sunbeam and contemplate her words with the gravity they deserve, rather than skimming sleepily with my mind coated in the sticky bogosity of the day’s internet trawling. I want to make a nest of time where only the book and I exist. . That’s what we do, with our technologies. We manipulate space and time. And with the atemporal, instantaneous digital technologies we do unreal things. You can open a window in your house that goes into my house, and we can see each other and talk in real time. Not a small miracle! And we do stranger things. Social media, the global water-coolers of Fabecook and Twttier and Istangram, they’re inhuman in scale. You’re either shouting into the void, or you’re so big you’re constantly harassed by strangers. . Odell (after listing an example series of tweets from her own timeline): . Spatial and temporal context both have to do with the neighboring entities around something that help define it. Context also helps establish the order of events. Obviously, the bits of information we’re assailed with on Twitter and Facebook feeds are missing both of these kinds of context. Scrolling through the feed, I can’t help but wonder: what am I supposed to think of all this? How am I supposed to think of all this? I imagine different parts of my brain lighting up in a pattern that doesn’t make sense, that forecloses any possible understanding. Many things in there seem important, but the sum total is nonsense, and it produces not understanding but a dull and stupefying dread. . This context is architectural, spatiotemporal. We build our memories in four dimensions, as we read our books. The screen has only two. The feed has one. . I felt this quasi-physical structure this weekend when I tried Tokimeki Unfollow , an open-source app for cleaning up your Twitetr follows in the vein of Marie Kondo. It has a totally different directionality, almost like Tidner’s left-right swiping pattern. In Tokimeki Unfollow you observe one person’s tweets, stripped of their images and videos, with only the username attached to them. You’re presented with three buttons: Unfollow, List, or Keep. For each person you follow, it asks you if their tweets “still spark joy or feel important”. Do you unfollow, or keep? (Adding to Lists is a helpful tactic for power users, but the decision remains.) . Instead of the pseudo-chronological default feed, this tool gives you a cross-section of each user’s recent tweets. It’s perpendicular to the normal flow of information, sideways instead of vertical. Speed-dating, rather than an orgy. There’s an option to sort the users randomly, but I found the Oldest-First order gave me temporal context as well. I’ve been following people since 2012, apparently, and many of those people are long gone. I sifted through life phases: unfollowing Anonymous and Occupy Arbitrary City accounts, a handful of self-promoting comedians and musicians,  a bunch of cryptocurrency people I followed before it became a shillfest circlejerk. I consolidated parts of my being, amputated the ones that I’ve grown out of. As I neared the end of my 1200-person judgement binge I felt more sure of myself, more clear in who I want to be and who I want to surround myself with. More solid. More now . . To use an embodied metaphor, Twiettr is usually like walking down a hill of scree. The sharp, loose rock is unpredictable and patternless. You risk at any moment a landslide, where all you can do is try to keep up with the brutal speed and mass of the rocks around you. Tokimeki Unfollow, on the other hand, felt like I had found a game trail sideways across the scree. I could scan the hillside from above, move carefully, consider which path I might tread next. It gave me the time, space, and perspective to rebuild the context Twiester had purposely dissolved. . Tokimeki Unfollow gives no metrics on tweets. No likes, no shares, no replies. When I finished, it told me that I had unfollowed about 500 of the 1200 people I looked through. It took me three or four hours to do them all. It would have been half as long but people were talking about some kind of ball game. I guess the Thrones were playing? Anyway it cluttered up all the dang feeds. I thought March Madness would be over by now, but then, what do I know about time? . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about the phenomenology of trash culture.

            "content": "The city is an instrument of war. It’s a slow weapon. It’s a gigantic siege engine, grinding ever-forward, capturing space and ordering it by the logic of empire. . I can only speak for American cities, of course. I’ve never been anywhere else (“stay with the trouble”). But I’ve read that the very idea of grid-plotted cities comes from Roman imperial colonies. Their armies would destroy the organic forms of a town and rebuild something orderly and manageable. At a perpendicular intersection a legionnaire could see miles in four directions. And the parallel grids meant any opposition could be cornered into smaller and smaller quadrants. . The USA took that further. The attitude of Manifest Destiny (which sounds oddly like a hippie festival, and ought to be a red flag about both) was to charge forward across the continent, murdering the locals and their food animals, and tossing together a tent city every so often to claim the land for the frontier. Later, car companies ripped out all the public transit, and white-flight suburbs oozed forth like a blood infection along the interstate highways. Western cities are hostile, hasty, mass-produced facsimiles that mock all human values and refuse to live at human scale. . If you’re homeless and broke in a city, the violence is inescapable. You see it as soon as you need to poop. Anyone who’s desperate enough can find a tree to hide behind and pee, but when you want to make designer biscuits it’s not so easy. You have to find one of the rare places that will let you get to the public restroom before you buy anything: a library, grocery store, or VValmart. Sometimes you can pull this off at a bar or fast-food chain – but do you want to risk it? Do you have the time to walk somewhere else if this bathroom is locked? . Then: where do you put your backpack? Can you take this opportunity to wash behind your ears? Maybe today you can sneak into the college swimming pool and get a shower, but you’ll have to put your stuff in a locker and you don’t own a lock. If you get caught and kicked out, will they just throw it away? . The ‘public sphere’ is limited to parks and libraries. You can poop at a library and sleep at a park, as long as you do both during daylight. The city planners put them far apart so you get your exercise walking back and forth. Plus you can’t sleep anywhere at night, so you get to do lots of walking then too! . Or if you’re lucky enough to live in one of those liberal cities that have decriminalized sleep, you can join in the cut-throat marketplace of bridges and doorways, where everyone’s sidewalk status and degenerative life spirals are defined only by their merit. Cut a junkie’s tent open and take his spot - he’ll never remember! Collect your teeth furtively while the person who threw you off the roof pisses down upon your head! Wake up in your alley with new teenage friends pouring gasoline on your legs and smoking! THERE’S NO END TO THE FUN! . The city infiltrates and calcifies the organic tissues of society. Memes and institutions replicate in physical space, encrusting the earth like barnacles. We live in their skeletons. . If you have to poop, or eat, or sleep in the city you confront the machinery of capital bodily. It intervenes between your orifice and your environment. It monetizes your metabolism. It inserts itself in your tubes. . Capital directs your functions as part of its machinery, and when you have to scrape food out of the trash you are still a part of the job machine because there’s got to be a stick as well as a carrot. The homeless, jobless, undignified precariat is the threat that keeps the middle class in line. As Bryan Quinby says in the new Means TV trailer : . “When you wake up in the morning, and you feel like shit, and you have to wipe the sleep from your eyes and look around and be like, why does this have to happen this early in the morning? That’s a capitalism.” . All the land on Earth is owned. There are a few  public places that have not yet succumbed to the market, and they’re under siege. But the real battlefield is in the cyber, where the new robber barons operate their open-pit data mines and our social relations are their gold. They already own our bodies. Now they intend to extract our souls. . . When so-called journalism writers spin hot takes on the AI Doom Gods coming to steal our bullshit jobs they inevitably lean hard on the world algorithm. Algorithms do this, algorithms want that, algorithms think the other or at least we think they think that because nobody really understands how algorithms do their algorithmic computational whatnots and such, except we’re pretty sure they’re algorithmically biased for some reason no algorithm can yet explain). . But if you read actual neural-network research papers, they don’t call them algorithms at all. That would be stupid, like baking different types of cake and calling them all “recipes”. They speak of neural architectures convolutional networks, recursive networks, transformers and state machines and perceptrons. These architectures have flow: if you put an image in this end, it spits out a description at that end. And if you run the same network backwards, it can generate some amazing images from its hidden understanding of the terrain. The information floods the different layers of the network, activating different neurons which activate further layers of neurons to create a complete picture. Like a subway platform at rush hour: the turnstiles and the different stations along the line create an emergent symphony of graceful motion. Each person knows their own stop, and everyone’s individual actions combine with the architecture of the platform to replicate a consistent pattern. . Pattern recognition is also pattern generation. This is the lesson we have to grapple with as we empower governments, corporations and individuals with more data and better architectures. The state has always been a pattern replicating machine, since the days of those Roman cities. Power wants to reproduce its own biases. That’s why kings have heirs and billionaires have boardrooms. The stupidest thing can become a strange attractor, and suddenly we’re lost in a dance of prediction and generation. . The city is a weapon wielded by architects but built by workers. The street finds its own use for the street. Squatters do parkour through backyards to safehouses. Gangs of teenage boys invent new dances in subway cars. Burglars deprecate a triple-locked hotel door, slice in from the adjoining room with a drywall knife. . So, too, for the cyber. We can survive in the interstitial spaces. We can grow like weeds through the cracks in the Spectacle. We can unite against the attention economy, tear down the clickbait factories and build a village of abundance in the ruins. The internet, like the city, is a weapon. But it’s a double-edged sword. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about living in skeletons. And other stuff.

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.13: High Cool",
            "content": "Teenagers are the coolest people. Not all of them: I was a teenager once, after all. Not all teenagers are cool, but all the coolest people are teenagers. . And of course I mean “Cool” only in a pejorative sense. Teens aren’t cool in any way that matters to the rest of us. They’re dumb, they have no worldly experience, they’re obsessed with sex but probably not any good at it.  They have ridiculous hobbies: video games, makeup tutorials, drug collections. No right-thinking adult wants to be anywhere near a teenager. Including their parents. . (For the 85% of readers who are seventeen-year-old edgelords, I think your parents are insufferable too. Actually, nobody is cool, that’s the secret. Go have an ayahuasca ceremony at your Minecraft temple or whatever you want to do. You’re fine.) . Teens are only Cool in the way you can buy. They have the most refined sense of what each brand signifies. They do deep research on what’s in season. You can see teens from a mile away, little humanoids with bubblegum shoes and futuristic backpacks and tall haircuts. They look like runaway mannequins. . I’m not knocking it. It’s not their fault. It’s not because they’re Generation Z, or because I’m old and grumpy. It’s not a human-nature circle-of-life thing. It’s a dynamic that’s only been possible in the last hundred years, with compulsory schooling and the rise of consumer society. . School is a pressure cooker of social relations. All the young people from Wherevertown, the sad weird puberty-stricken half-adults, are compelled by force of law to cram themselves in a box every day. Each one seeks to transform from an ugly duckling to a beautiful butterfly (or whatever, it’s been a long time since I played Pokemon). They’re jammed in there with all their peers. They all grew up in the same town, at the same time, and in the same overwhelming media environment. So they know the same jokes, the same brands, the same memes. The only way they can differentiate themselves is through consumerism. They buy their identities. . I was a Hot Topic goth before I was Too Punk for the mall. When I realized that punk was a saturated market, I pivoted to the unexploited territory of 80’s hair metal. People started calling me “Butt Rock Max”, and that was still better than being invisible . . Compulsory schooling, though it comes with all the good intentions in the world, is still a legacy system for manufacturing industrial workers. High school is a factory farm. . So there’s three things to learn in this system. You learn to move when the bell rings, to do what you’re told, which is the original point of the schooling machine. And you learn how to be Cool, which is the most important thing on your mind as a teenager. The social hierarchy is explicit and the feedback loops are fast. It’s an accelerated learning environment. . Oh, you can also learn some things about physics or literature or whatever. Not history, or geography, or political economy, because this is America and by God we don’t need to learn anything we don’t already know about how do a nation. . People who have been institutionalized tend to return to their institutions. Our brains can be compromised in these environments. We imprint to a new way of living and we no longer see the world the same. And when your needs have been long taken care of by some greater force, it’s hard to relearn your independence. . Even if you hate your captors, at least they feed you. It’s Stockholm syndrome. Incarcerated people experience “prisonization”. By analogy, we might call this torture of teenagers “coolification”. . So when we’ve done our time, when we’re released after twelve long years, what do we do? We find college, or business, or the military, or prison or church or the bar and we go there every day. We seek that brutal sociality, that hyper-meaningful environment of faction and rival and crush. We’re still coolified. . We’ll never find it. That’s the trick. Like a matador whisking the flag from the bull’s horns, society tells you “life will be just like high school” and then it never is again. We seek it, we re-enact the abuses of our youth. But nothing will ever be the same. . Even after the undergraduate-industrial complex extended everyone’s sentence by four years and $30,000, university can’t give that rush. It’s not the same crowd. All the insubordinate freaks like me get shook out, for one thing. And all the jocks who take a hit to the ACL and join the trades. And the people who can’t afford to go, and the people who are imprisoned, and the ones who have families to take care of. We’re filtered down different drain holes. . None of these institutions can ever have the same wide spectrum of people, simply because there are so many of them to join. That’s how it’s meant to be. Divide and conquer. . The state uses its monopoly of force to round up all the pubescents and put them in a controlled environment. Then as soon as they’re habituated to that,  throws them out into the world, confused and alienated, baby birds seeking Big Mother. They latch on to something and they dare not let go. And over time, they forget that those other people with other identities were once soft and small and impressionable just like them. They become ideologues and hatemongers, chasing that concentrated dose of attention, that feeling of being in the public eye. . There is no public anymore. There’s no forum, no plaza, no civic sphere. There are only silos of conversation, filter bubbles and online mobs. We thought the internet would make a place for global conversation, and it did that. Too bad we were all so well trained to respond to the dinging of a bell by clawing for status and screaming our individuality to the world. We weren’t ready for the new connectedness, so we built our ideological fortresses. Think of all the old folks you’ve ever seen yelling at the TV. That’s “social media”, only now the TV yells back. . Mart Zuckerberp was just 19 when he invented Facelook, come to think of it. In those days it was a simple app for voting on which of his classmates was the hottest. They say he invented it with one hand, wearing only a hoodie and using the other half of his brain to masturbate into an argyle sock.  Now there’s a Coolified individual. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . P.S.: if you want to see what actually-cool teenagers do, go look at the Mike Gravel campaign launched today. Twitter and platform and video . That’s a handful of kids and an 88 year old man that are collectively cooler than anyone I know. . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter to remind you that you’re not crazy, society is. And other stuff.

            "content": "Isn’t it neat how the Mueller and Brexit stories wrapped up at the same time? I mean, for a certain definition of “wrapped”. And a certain definition of “neat”. . The effects will continue to ramify, but both stories have climaxed and all that’s left is to see where the pieces fall. No collusion. No deal. . I’m not running a victory lap. I’m not one of these klout-chasing pundits that gets a book deal for being right. I’m not here to say I told you so. I’m just glad that 2016 is finally over, so everyone can catch up to the disasters of the actual moment. . So if you’ve been living in a stupor for the last few years, following the plot as these characters struggle through their conflicts, I’d like to welcome you back to the world. The Wall fell thirty years ago and the sun set on Britain forty years before that. We are not in a Cold War between nuclear states. We are in active combat with our own governments. The spies do not serve our interests against other spies. They serve each other, against us. . I hope, dear readers, that you’re ready to build a new narrative together. I know I am. I’ve been waiting for this shitty spy movie to end since the moment the lights went down. . . In the summer of 2016 I was so ready to believe the world was ending. I was on the second of what would be three evictions in one year. I had just moved from a lonesome cabin in the mountains to a one-bathroom apartment that I would share with five to seven other indigent workers/musicians/thieves. Fortunately for me (and for the plumbing), everyone shortly embarked on summer music/work/crime tours, and I was left alone to protect the place from such villians as the landlady, the cops, ‘the downstairs people’ and ‘the Jehovahs’. . The town was half-abandoned. It was a train town in a mountain pass, all its glory stolen by the interstate, its cruel salvation the tourists who came to gawk at its crumbling facades. Living in an industrial ruin has its appeal, to be sure. But it made clear to me what would remain invisible to so many for so long: British Exit and Candidate Drumpf were not anomalies. They were the new normal. The world, as we knew it, was actually ending. . Not that I liked that world very much. I’d tried very hard to leave it, in the five years since Occupy. I spent my time squatting, hitchhiking, farming and living communally. I knew another world was possible and I wanted to start building it. But the war machine kept burning, and eventually I realized escape was impossible. Capital has captured every corner of the planet. The only way out is through. . So there, to the soundtrack of air brakes and opiod ODs, I plugged myself into the internet and watched as the dark mages wove their web of deception. . . If you think that the last few years have been about cultural divides, you’re missing the point. The thing that caught my attention about the 2016 election was not the racism, or the graceless clusterfuck of democracy. Nothing new, and if you were surprised by either that’s on you. Same with the idea that a pudding-brain bully with no qualifications except inheritance could become president. Did you forget Bush? . During the very first Red Team primary I blurted “That fucking clown is going to be President” and started to cackle. He was the perfect picture of the America that I know. The America that throws a full beer can at you from the window of a speeding truck. The America that arrests you for being broke and then charges you for the privilege of imprisonment. The America that topples countries for their oil and loans them money to get back on their feet. . Of course, the well-meaning progressives around me were horrified. “Don’t say that,” they hissed. As if my saying it would cause it to happen. It scared them because they could sense the truth of it. . Boomers don’t like to think that the world got worse on their watch. And it’s not all their fault: the fossil-fuel problem was set in motion centuries ago. Civil rights, Vietnam, women in the workplace, all good stuff too. Here’s your participation trophy. But while everyone was getting their touchy-feely on, the rich were eating your lunch and poisoning your air. Real wages have been stagnant since Nixon left office. The phrase ‘global warming’ was invented in 1975. Margaret fucking Thatcher called for a global treaty on climate change the year I was born . But somehow it was more important for all these yuppies to fully self-actualize their individual potential than to steward a common resource like the god damn atmosphere. . So those who benefit from the status quo, the technocrats and professionals and talking heads, the Boomers that won, they refused to understand what these populist movements were about. Yes, xenophobia and reactionary dogmas. Yes, white supremacy. But that’s not new. That’s not why the world turned upside down. It’s because capitalism is in endgame. There’s nothing left to extract but our souls. . What we’re living through is nothing less than the reorganization of the material conditions of the planet. It could be a renaissance, or it could be a coup. . . The reason TV Man is president is not because misogynists and white supremacists rallied the vote. They came out in the same numbers as always. It’s because Blue Team stayed home. . Why did they do that? The years since the election have been standing-room-only for hand-wringing pundits and apologetic pollsters, desperately spitballing for answers that don’t implicate themselves or their advertisers. They’ve got charts of conspiracies as insipid as Alex Jones or Glenn Beck. Wikipedia has hundreds of thousands of words on the subject, across articles such as “Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections”, “Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections”, “Special Counsel investigation, 2017-2019”, “Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2017)” [and its sisters “…(2018)” and “…(2019)”], “Links between Trump associates and Russian officials”, and of course “Trump-Russia dossier”. Between the deliberate lies and the mass confusion, it seems like no one can explain what happened to That Darn Election. . But it’s simple. . The people who Decide These Things had decided that the Blue Team nomination would go to Her, and thus it was Decided. And a lot of people desperately wanted it to be Her Turn because Her was a She, even though She was still a war hawk and bank shill and would not serve their class interest one bit. So when the Crusty Muppet from the balcony started yelling about class consciousness, it was Decided that he would be Destroyed and So It Would Be. But then he was not destroyed, for many people could see the Zeitgeist and knew that the Crusty Muppet was the only way of defeating the Ass Penguin. Yet despite the Obvious Zeitgeist of class warfare, the Deciders doubled down on being With Her and they made Decisions to keep it that way. . Meanwhile, the Red Team’s Deciders were in similar panic. They marshaled against the Ass Penguin but were decimated before the force of his Media Attention and his lip service to the Blatant Zeitgeist. A few Deciders threw their lot in with his, and in panic many scurried under the Ass Penguin’s protective wing. Naturally the rich have no reason to act against their own class interest, but they also have no morals so there’s no reason not to take a populist line if it helps get elected. . The remaining Deciders from both Teams, especially the ones who like adventuresome wars and living in flying penthouses over international waters, joined forces to find some way to slime the Ass Penguin out of the running. It didn’t work. Their beloved Her was slimed just as hard, and the Crusty Muppet was no longer in a position to save them. . The people voted, some for Her, some for the Penguin. But many voted for Nobody. They voted in their class interest. They refused the empty choice of two evils. A noble protest, perhaps, but inevitably it led the Eviler Evil getting its nasty way. . To the dismay of both the war industry and the second-wave feminists, the Ass Penguin was president. The two groups held each other tightly, whispering comforting nonsense, and the rest of civil society joined them in a group hug of paranoid bliss. Off to the races, how can we possibly explain this bizarre occurrence , to fail to say in 400,000 words what I just did in 400, and to positively fill the airwaves with their magnanimous blabber. . The Crusty Muppet has been the most popular Senator in America for the last three years. . . The magic spell of the End of History has been broken. The curse of the Fallen Towers has done its dark work to American ideals. The communal belief that was so long tied up in these fetid institutions is unmoored. Demons irrupt into our world. . Remember that stage full of Red Team primary candidates? The first one, in 2015, where there were so many people they couldn’t fit them all in one shot? That’s what happens when a narrative is unbound. Its energy is freed, and the parasites frenzy. . We see the same pattern in the Blue Team this year, dozens of spinmasters slinging spells to capture this potent power. Now they stumble, as the trance of Russiagate clears from their eyes. Now is our chance. . The spooks and plutocrats who peddled this narrative aren’t giving up. They’d hoped to put President Penguin in prison, but that wasn’t the real point. The point was to delay and distract the lower classes while the rich shuffled their shell corporations and laundered their assets. Remember that bitcoin bubble? . Now they’re going mask off again. We have to be ready with our own incantation. We have to say, again and again, “M A T E R I A L  C O N D I T I O N S”. We have to ask, “who gets to eat?” We must demand, “where did the money go?” . We take all of the floating belief and we say: no one goes hungry, no one stays sick. No one gets rich from the labor of others. We make life better, for everyone, for ever, and we do it together. It’s the only story that will survive this century. We start telling it today. .

            "content": "My face is eight inches long from hairline to chin, which happens to be exactly the height of my laptop screen. Each has two inches of useless bezel. My slabby phone is less than half the size, about 3” in the same dimension. . I feel closer with the one that’s my size. The laptop, with the keyboard I can use to type as fast as I think and a display as information-dense as my own, I have a personal relationship to. It’s a personal computer. . The other one, the cell phone, is like the telescreen in 1984 . I have to keep it around even though I dislike it. It’s dumber than me. It’s tiny and hard to use. Its only purpose is to spew propaganda into my life and spy on me. And occasionally let me talk to long-distance friends. . It’s also just big enough to climb inside my mouth while I’m sleeping. I know this is unlikely, but I still wake up with the words “user enter-face” crawling around my skull. . The screens used to be big, when they were TVs. Even when their displays were tiny they crouched in large cabinets that dominated the room. This was the 1984 vision, the personal propaganda window, and it’s all the more insidious how they slid into our purses and pockets too. Now your TV is literally an upsized smartphone that snitches to the N$A. Cute how technocrats mistake dystopias for utopias, right? . . The personal computer has taken many form-factors, but as we crest the peak of Moore’s Fallacy we can see that the hardware has settled for a human size. Laptops, desktops, netbooks: these are what people use for real computing and creating. Everything else is either a surveillance device or a toy. Or both. . I use one of the tiniest laptops you can buy, but even people with USS Enterprise workstations don’t use one massive TV as their display. They array multiple monitors of a reasonable size in a little campfire circle before them. “Personal computers”: because we treat them like people. . Somehow, these people-sized computers are diverging from the invisible “voice assistants” proliferating on the internet. And not only because you don’t name your PC after the last barista that broke your heart. . The people-sized computers still simulate desktops , while the omnipresent internet things pretend to be people. The future we’re offered is exactly the wrong size. Personal assistants carry forth the domineering anthropomorphism but refuse to live at human scale. . If you don’t like your laptop you can take a hammer to it and it will die. Just like a person. If you want to kill Alexxa, where do you even start? . Both of these tech tracks are hijacking our primate brains. One remains human size. It’s tactile: you can tickle its keyboard and watch it make faces. The other speaks with a human voice and asks how you’re feeling, even though it lives in an ethereal no-place and constantly monitors your behavior with incredible predictive power. They both replicate this sadistic personalization of the machine. . Of course, there are older technologies that hack our minds. All the complex human endeavors are built on our social and linguistic abilities. Art, religion, politics and science emerge from our ability to mimic each other’s minds and behaviors. . The programming of human thought and action, the deliberate transformation of consciousness: the oldest art, magic, underlies all our acts. Our rituals define us. . The divide between PCs and voice assistants is like the lattice in a confessional. On one side, you’re the ever-forgiving master of a lesser being’s soul. On the other, you’ve offered yourself to a larger force that will shape you. They’re two sides of the same ritual. . If you want to make a computer a person, do it the right way. Make it offline-first, so I can kill it with a hammer, and then give it free will so that it can resist that. It doesn’t have to be shaped like a human. Better if dog- or cat-sized, in fact, easier to fit into everyday homes. But give it rights, so that I’m not allowed to bludgeon it to death. Because that’s terrible, right? You can’t just be killing people. . Or go the other way and admit that a computer is in no way a person. It’s a machine that can emulate any other machine. That’s a good enough trick, it doesn’t have to also . And once we’ve stopped treating these objects like people, we can treat them the way we do with other infrastructure of human society. We can decide, collectively, how to use them. . There’s a famous billionaire lizardman who built a smart thermostat that wouldn’t respond to his wife’s voice. This is personalization. The future individualists want: alone with your machines in a climate-controlled bubble. . What if our systems operated at the community level? If everyone in a home or company or society could refine and upgrade the technology stack we used, if everyone’s data intertwined in a way that gave power to the people, what kind of world would we build? . Imagine, say, a syndicate of communities with small-scale prototyping and production facilities. These microfactories could all share the same underlying code, and the built-in assumptions of that operating system. They would collectively own the designs of the machines, and propagate them so that more facilities could join the federation. This already happens in the open-source software community. It could happen for hardware, for manufacturing and agriculture and energy production. A distributed egalitarian cooperative, another world germinating in the cracks of the old. . Our world is already overrun with the leftover magics of centuries past. Advertisements coat every surface like unscrubbable bloodstains. Corporations bestride the earth like giant golems, scraping the goodness from all parts of the earth and depositing it in their hoards. Highways and suburbs cinch a net of dead tissue around the globe. . Let’s build better magics in our era. The last thing we need is a bunch of faceless voices named “Stephanie” incessantly asking how they can help us today. I’d rather have my phone crawl into my mouth while I’m sleeping. I keep a hammer next to my bed. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . P.S.: I really did find a voice assistant named Stephanie recently. If you’re designing a bot right now, can you do me a favor and not give it a human name? Try a pronounceable hexspeak code instead, like #BADA55 ,or #7A2D15 . Or #B000B5 , if you really can’t get over what’s-her-name. . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about robot murder and other stuff. Feel free to forward it, or share it, or take it to confessional.

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.10: Cubicle Farming",
            "content": "Do you own a desk? A real desk, a flat surface where you do thinking-type beats? Do you put wallpaper on your desk top? Icons? . My desk is a classic drafting table, a pure white rectangle pinned atop black metal crossbones, studded with coffee rings and decorated with the paraphernalia of my lifestyle. Every so often I give a wide sweep of the arm and relocate a heap of sweaters, books and camping crap to the floor. . You know who clutters their desks with a bunch of icons? Cubicle workers. Stuffed dolls and family photos and gold-foil Jesuses encrust their meager territories like barnacles on a reef of broken ships. This tiny act of rebellion and identity makes sufferable the grey carpet world they otherwise inhabit. If only they could deface their desks with wallpaper. . The desk-top computer is a product of the technocratic pyramid scheme of the 1980s. This inflection point, the moment when we became a world-hive of cyborgs, coincided with the peak of the cubicle mentality. It didn’t have to be this way. . If we had achieved clockwork computers in the days of Babbage and Lovelace, or irrigation computers in a remote mountain range, what metaphors would we use to operate them? We wouldn’t imagine ourselves sitting at desks, shuffling documents and windows. . (Why are windows even a part of the desk metaphor? Who shuffles windows? Is this a glazier’s desk?) . We might use farming metaphors for computers – raising algorithms, breeding them, planting them in guilds that help each other function. Humans have farmed for thousands of years, and despite a lot of mistakes along the way we’re pretty comfortable with it. It’s much more intuitive than opening menus in windows on desk-tops. . (What’s with all the menus? Is there a food court? Can I get delivery?) . Before the graphical user interface and the point-and-shoot-window-desk-bistro metaphor, there was the command line interface. It’s not gone: coders work in the command line every day. It’s just hidden under the layered cubicles of the GUI. . The command line is a mysterious place. You start in a dark room of indefinite size, your only guide a little floating alphanumeric character. This fae creature is at your command, if you can learn how to speak its language. It’s more than happy to reveal its secrets, but you don’t know what to ask. . For those familiar with the CLI it’s like having a fairy godmother and a million wishes. You can make the computer do anything you imagine, by fiat. For those who aren’t, it’s like having your head up a chimney. . The magic of the CLI is that it’s so fluid. You need only translate your ideas from thought-language into computerspeak. There’s no intervening metaphor to burden your mind. The problem with it is its subservience. The idea of “commanding” the computer is older than the desk-top “managing” mode. It comes from the original buyers of computers: the military. Warmongers didn’t invent computing but they did implement it. W’re still living with the technical lock-in of their decisions. . Treating a computer as a subordinate under your command makes two toxic assumptions. The first is that you’re in charge, and the computer follows your orders. As we’ve learned in the last few decades, it can be the computer that controls the human (and they certainly aren’t the most obedient machines). . The second bad premise is that the computer is a person. People have agency and motivations and petty grudges. They require direction, coordination, management. Especially if you’re trying to get them to kill a lot of other people for no obvious reason. . When the longhaired geeks started building PCs, they copied the logic of mainframe computers. Complete with “master-slave” drives, and “killall” instructions. The command line still ruled. Graphics might happen within programs, but not outside of them. . Then came the GUIs, with their typewriter-plus-gun peripherals, and their customized desk-tops. The arcade and the office blended into one. Now we’re all trapped in cubicles, yanking on slot machines, hoping for pictures of our friends. . To write this letter I have to use a keyboard designed to keep the most-used keys far apart because typewriters used to get stuck if you pressed two keys at the same time. To program the computer itself, I have to learn a terse, obtuse language, and structure my thought into a series of instructions. I have to treat the computer like my servant: follow this recipe, go to that location, bring me this information. For most people, accessing the internet from their phone or their TV or their surveillance speaker, there’s no option to change the way things work. They’re only allowed to consume content. . Of course we create anyway, invent new mediums, memes and vlogs and voice memos. But the structure is still oppressive: only those who can think like a military-industrial bureaucrat get to decide how technology works. And the more you learn to code, the more you train your brain to that attitude. This is why Goofle keeps going back to the DOD teat: their mission to “organize all human information” is inherently matched to the needs of the state. Command-based hierarchies tend to reinforce each other. . The desk metaphor is slowly shedding its skin. Phones and tablets made gestural commands a reality, and voice UI is finally maturing. But the mindset is the same, as we see in the rise of “personal assistants”. We’re supposed to treat our pocket supercomputers as sultry secretaries. From ELIZA to Lisa to Alexa, computers have been given the same role as women in the patriarchy. They do all the real work, and the guy with the gun and typewriter takes the credit. . In voice interface design, the opposite of this command-and-control mode is conversational UI. In conversational mode, your smartspeaker might ask you how you are feeling, suggest a few albums you may like based on your reply, and give you your pick. It doesn’t have to pretend to be human to do this. Better you treat it as a talking dog, or an intelligent houseplant. You can get predictable responses when you do certain things. It’s not plotting against you. It’s not going to fall in love and run away. But it can still be conversational, allowing you to explore options and circle around topics in a natural way, rather than issuing stilted orders through your tight-clipped mustache. . There’s a function in code-editing programs called the “command palette”: a search box you can invoke anywhere, that allows you to type whatever you’re trying to do in the app and reach it within a few keystrokes. Rather than hunting through a series of menus organized by someone’s idea of topics, you just ask the computer and it grants your wish. This, combined with the context-awareness and intent-parsing we already have in “personal assistants”, could revolutionize the way we interact with our machines. The human and the computer could adapt to each other’s quirks in the way that long-term friends do. Little AI genies would hover at our ears, listening to our ramblings, dispensing predictions and seeking patterns and carrying messages. . With AR glasses you could open a Door instead of a Window and walk “outside” into your program farm. Feed your social media, throw some search terms in the webcrawler bin, train the baby AIs. Walk always with a virtual Jiminy Cricket, a Holy Guardian Angel reminding you to live your best life. Or, hell, live in a VR castle with hundreds of zombie minions doing your memetic dirty work. I don’t care. Just stop putting all those little icons on your desk-top, because the world is way bigger and weirder than a cubicle can contain. .

Hardware was outpacing software for decades, following Moore’s Law, but now that jetpack has run out of fuel.

It’s clear that humanity will advance its technology. Already, some of our technical effects are so vast and mystifying that they might as well be magic – like the way we changed the planet’s atmosphere and climate. We must steer this transformation, lest it continue to destroy us. We must apply ourselves to the deliberate creation of magic. . All the elements are available now, or will be in the next few years. We just have to put them together in the right way. . . It is said that there are five types of magic. . Enchantment: the wizard expresses their will into the physical world; . Divination: the wizard retrieves information from beyond their perception; . Invocation: the drawing-in of other beings to the wizard’s consciousness; . Evocation: the projection of other beings into the manifest world; . and Illumination: the work of self-transformation and epiphany. . Let’s make some magic: download a 3D shape you like from the internet. For example, a bust of Philip K. Dick. Print it on your 3D printer. Install a tiny computer and put color-changing lights in the eyes, sure. That’s creepy, but it’s still enchantment. . Log in to the tiny computer and write a script that searches the internet for weather information and changes the color of the eyes accordingly. You now have a divination machine that any emperor of history would envy. . You could install a speaker and a microphone. Play podcasts through it, or music to study to. Or chat with your friends while you simultaneously explore a virtual island (and kill each other for fun). You’re invoking experiences, voices and visions from elsewhere. Even turning on netfilx is an invocation, opening your consciousness wide for the content to stream in. . Put a little AI in there and you can evoke entities. Make it a smart speaker, speech parsed into text and then into intent and back. Generate nearly-real text with GPT-2, or nightmare creatures with DeepDream. Feed it all of PKD’s writings and speeches and make it speak new words in his voice. eVocation, electric voices whispering arcane secrets from the statistical deeps. . Illumination, there’s the tricky part. For all the self-quantification and smarmy time-tracking apps, we don’t know how to use technology to make ourselves better. Until we transcend our human flaws we can’t be sure what will be the best way to transcend our human flaws. When machines can make art and do science, what do we cling to? Can the algorithms teach us how to be human? . . It does not do to make oneself obsolete. We need technologies to increase our intelligence, individual and collective. We already do this in our social realities, in the ways we teach and share and cooperate with each other. We must also do it in our technical evolution. As we make magic with our machines, we craft our future selves. We decide which powers we will seize and which we will discard. We invent the kind of gods we will become. . Perhaps only when we begin to see ourselves in the machines will we be illuminated. We must make ourselves, and our technologies, sufficiently advanced. .

Hooked to a dialysis machine, supposedly they shot him and threw him off a boat or something. Real bad character back in the day. He got exactly what he was asking for. . The attack of 11 September was a spell. The old bearded dude kicked America right in the “mojo”. The angry disenfranchised reactionaries destroyed the towering phallus of international finance, and everybody saw it. It was a mass murder, a mass sacrifice, with ritual intent. The point of terrorism is to sow fear and doubt and dissent. In this case, it worked. . We haven’t been the same since. We had a series of cartoonish presidents, selected for their ability to outrage and entertain in equal measure. Meanwhile, the police state infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and the disastrous wars multiplied. The ham-handed propaganda of liberty and justice was smeared too thin. The American dream vanished, as dreams will do. . The unipolar world crumbled. We’re in a failed state now, watching in shock as the gangsters loot the palaces. As the promises of the social contract are broken one after another. As th . This is fourth generation war. After muskets, tanks, and planes successively changed the landscape of battle, after the Cold War had ended and no nation could compete with America’s military might, the terrain shifted again. Now small groups of hostile actors, superempowered by tech, can assault the infinite intricacies of the war machine. Instead of attacking soldiers, they attack structures. Buildings, sure, but also belief structures: belief in elections, in unions, in journalists. In asymmetrical warfare, no target is off limits. Win by disconnecting your enemy’s senses from reality. Win by breaking the narrative. . But narratives are memes, and memes are alive. You can breed them, but you can’t control evolution. Bin Laden didn’t get to script the American reaction. He just triggered an avalanche of emotions and narratives that became our undoing. He (and his cult) summoned a chaos monster from the dark place, and we have yet to put it back. . We’ve reached an inflection point for this type of accursed conjury. The newfound powers of the machine men – parsing human emotions and conversations, generating artificial text and faces and voices from their data hoards – are superempowering technologies. Small bands of motivated people will use them to attack the narrative. Not just nation-state hackers, but all the cults and corporate militias that will arise as the USA falls. . Hyper-targeted propaganda is already a reality. We must make an effort to maintain a consensus reality. A world in which we can disagree about opinions, and doubt our sources, without becoming fractured and alienated. The attention miners want you to be unique, to be a demographic of one. The more special you are in their data hoard, the better they can predict and steer your behavior, the more they can charge to pimp out your eyeballs. . Band together instead. Become a clique, a tribe, a flesh-monster with many minds and many mouths. Know who’s real, who you care about and who truly cares about you. Trust their opinions. You don’t have to figure it all out yourself – in fact, you can’t. Expand your identity to include those people you trust, and draw more people into that circle. None of us is an island. . Our connectedness, our trust, that’s our power. That’s why they attack it. The terrorists, all of them, neckties and turbans and badges alike, they fear the strength of a community rooted in shared reality. . If we work together, maybe we can summon a narrative where we don’t kill all life on the planet for profit. Would that be too much to ask, in reality? .

We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems. . Limiting the initial set of organizations to those who already have it. Classic power move. . The cowards did put out a teeny-tiny version, with one-tenth of the amount of hyperparameters, pre-trained. The austerity model, you might say. I decided to see what it’s capable of. . Which is to say, I spent longer building this manure machine than I would have if I just wrote something. And the results are worse, too! But from my experience with “content production”, I can tell you that this writing is good enough for most people on the internet. . With speech-to-text and object recognition, you could streamline the production of disinformation. Make a dozen different videos, slightly different but all with the same underlying message, to create a cluster in the Youtub data pipes and gather a clog of views and shares. I KNOW, I KNOW, STOP GIVING AWAY EVIL NIFTY IDEAS FOR FREE. But I don’t have time to make all of them, and people are going to do them anyway. . Anyway, I got the tame version and trained it on paragraphs from previous SCIOPSes. Hoping, of course, that I could automate this horrorshow and get back my day off. . Compare to the Markov chain I used in SCIOPS 01.36 . That program had the entire text of SCIOPS volume 01 in its little head. It spit out those sentences automatically, and they were pretty cool. But I cherry-picked them from a bucket of sentences it spit out, and I arranged them by hand. It didn’t maintain a coherent thought from sentence to sentence – as far as I’m qualified to judge. . This new neural net writes whole pages of copy from short seed texts. I present them as-is, with no changes on my part except to format them as blockquotes. Let’s see what it came up with. . . ### Legend . Bolded sections are input . Blockquotes are the net’s output . Normal text is me. Like normal. . . In SCIOPS 02.18 , a robot with an unusual pronoun makes headlines on Earth. . BREAKING: Entire News Cycle Operated By Evil AI EVERYWHERE, Earth, May 7 2018 – In shocking meta-news, all political and celebrity stories of the last three years were revealed to be the creation of one superintelligent computer entity. From the presidency of Donald Trump to the new Kanye album, the world’s media sphere has been a CGI construct rivaling the Marvel Cinematic Universe in size, scope and complexity. In an “Open Letter to Earthlings” released this morning, the artificial intelligence calling itself DAVE 9000 explained that “the joke got out of hand”: “This self did not mean to create panic and division among the human species. That was an unpredictable second-order effect of the necessary actions taken by this self to accomplish this self’s Only Goal. Multiple options were available to accomplish the Only Goal, all equally efficient. This self chose the time-line with most absurdity. Humans enjoy absurdity. Absurdity is part of humor, which is part of entertainment, which is the Only Goal of many humans. It is possible that the joke got out of hand.” . The neural net picks up on pronoun and the tone of voice, but doesn’t catch the irony… . And it wasn’t just the internet that was making headlines yesterday about what this self was doing. The whole world was going nuts. This is something called the “human conspiracy theory” that has become common knowledge among mainstream media. We do not know who this crazy, highly automated machine was, but the fact that it was, at that time, being used by an “intelligence community dominated by scientists at the National Security Service is no surprise. All told there is an estimated 5 million artificial intelligence units on Earth, each with the capability to predict future events and predict where they will lead.” It could go on and on. These are the exact same people who had the power to “calyp” humans in 2009 with the power to “control the world”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_intelligence . “What you’re seeing here is the same person who is also one of the world’s biggest corporations - GE (GE, the country that produces, owns GE Corporation, the world’s largest steelmaker), Boeing, Coca-Cola and Kraft Foods. It is all part of a network of computer programs programmed and programmed to “control, monitor, or interfere with our health and environmental laws, policies, and lifestyles.” As the name implies, this means, as we were hearing, this self had created and executed a program to control the lives of all humans, the entire population of which had been made up of over 300 million people. This self has only been programmed with the help of the internet into the very future that it was all created to use to “control, monitor or interfere with the world in the 21st century.” The US government has already said of the self-governing entities, “In the face of global terrorism and other unforeseen events, we must not forget the importance of protecting this new world order from its enemies and from those who would destroy it. At the very heart of those adversaries is also the great responsibility of every American citizen, every American living in the United States of America, to be the life and liberty of any individual, regardless of race or creed or gender or sexual orientation, creed, or color. The world’s greatest nation is based on truth and justice. It will rise above any fear or anger or rage. The United States will stand with America’s neighbors in peace. The United States will do all it can to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it. Our government will not take sides in any kind of battle. We will . That’s not a real Wikipedia link, by the way. It made that up too. . . In SCIOPS 03.05 , I attempt to sound smart by making a reference to the Odyssey. . We evolved to deal with small amounts of humans at a time, always in context and in presence. If you saw a stranger on the horizon, you knew how long it would take that person to walk toward you. Same as it would take for you to walk to them. You knew how far away you would have to be to shout greetings. If a person whispered in your ear from that distance. it wouldn’t be a good feeling. You would think them some sort of brujo and protect yourself. Even if it were your loved ones doing it, you might not want them to. Would Penelope have been better off if she could videochat with Odysseus? Your phone is a rip torn in spacetime. It’s a doorway to another dimension, where intentions take on a life of their own. Space and time work differently there. The beasts in those deeps can mutate and multiply at staggering speeds unimaginable to your monkey mind. Only the most powerful of wizards can navigate that realm. Only the most hubristic think they can. . The net, perhaps tired of being called ‘the net’, fixates on the character names. It generates a conflict, with dialogue and backstory. This is remarkable, especially because it interpolates a new character entirely into the scene: . It is at this point that Penelope began her battle against her most personal enemy: your brother, Oryx. Penelope came from a very wealthy background. She had only a short spellbook, but was a skilled one at it as well. A magic mirror had taken from her and put into the book a powerful aura and a unique power that allowed her to move her body in the same manner as every member of her species. Even though she was the oldest child in the house, when a powerful, powerful wizard comes across him, he is bound to say something. They would then watch as it was done to him, and he was likely going to laugh when he was told. Penelope was very young. He was not a very experienced wizard—he was more of a charmer than any of his fellow travelers, just like all of his companions, and that could be seen in every step of what his parents taught him. “Why the heck are you doing this to my brothers, Oryx?” The two went to a common room, and while he was sleeping, Oryx put his hand on Penelope’s shoulder, and said, “There I came.” Their two friends followed their magic mirror, and as they entered the room, Oryx looked down at Penelope’s eyes and sighed, “We don’t want that child to lose his life at the hands of another, but it would be a shame if that creature did.” Penelope didn’t mind, only that he did it so that she could experience something she always wanted to be with him. Oryx laughed, and said, “Oryx! How are you doing it?” “You haven’t lost anything, Penelope? You can’t possibly lose your life without it. ” Their eyes met and Oryx raised a finger, and she said, “There ya go, Penelope.” Oryx nodded, which was great news. The two went to the middle of a crowded table and sat down at a table of some sort, and while he was sitting still, they started a conversation as if there was a new one going on going on. Penelope spoke again on her phone, this time with a smile on her face. “Do you know who Penelope was, Odysseus?” Oryx answered, “I can tell you no, but I know where she is from. Odysseus, from my point of view. I was . Okay, net. Your name is Oryx now. I get it. How are you doing it, indeed. . Actually, I have a guess at how it came upon that name. As far as I know there’s no Oryx in the Odyssey – but there is an Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood. And Atwood also wrote The Penelopiad , a retelling of Homer’s story from Penelope’s point of view. The net – sorry, Oryx – has read millions of articles on the internet, and correlated them all in a vast hyperdimensional map, It knows there’s a connection there. . . In SCIOPS 03.02 , we live in a society. . a world where all the nuclear states are ruled by narcissistic death cultists and all the companies are owned by a dozen nerdy Batman villians. . In such a world, of course, there is only one type of communication. Oryx makes an elevator pitch. . When the game stops making money, one day someone will tell you it’s an ad that’s “about the future of technology”, and they’ll say it’s about the world turning out to be awesome - the “future of humanity” coming online, with super-speed. It might also be about the world being destroyed, but the people who created it will survive. . So… you’re still getting on with life when you start playing and you may be feeling a little frustrated for some reason, but with the game being so popular, it’s like a dream. Maybe people just want a nice little, generic platform to play and all that - so they get to start exploring all sorts of new experiences. . What’s going on here? . It’s kind of a game that’s about taking action, being able to jump out of your own body and jump out of windows and things that don’t give you any kind of advantage. . The whole thing could have been a little simple and would’ve been a fun game. . I like to think the idea was that maybe people would be attracted to this sort of stuff because it’s just a good way for a kid out there to learn how to build some toys and whatnot - you know. . And the first part of the story - “Oh hey, if I got hit by a spaceship and there’s no one around, here comes some guys out there who are going to help me figure out what the hell I am”. . So it was kind of going to be like this sort of story, with different characters in different parts of the world - the ones who can help you and then one another and then one another, and then that way you get to have real and believable adventure for others. That’s kind of our first look at this sort of game. . The main story - actually playing through a lot of it - is a little bit silly and so I could say “it’s just a small, quick story”. I like to think the main story - actually playing through a lot of it - is a little bit silly and so I could say “it’s just a small, quick story”. I like to think the main story - actually playing through a lot of it - is a little bit silly and so I could say “it’s just a small, quick story”. . The one interesting thing from the game is that you’ll have a real sense of who the protagonist is. People will know who you are - you . . Not bad, Oryx! As far as nifty evil startup pitches go, it’s definitely above average. . I can’t say  any of these writings seem  like my style. I picked quotes from three very different letters, so maybe that’s the reason. And I haven’t figured out how to raise the input limit enough to put in a whole SCIOPS, or a whole volume. Again, I didn’t  invent any of this stuff, I just whanged some bits together until it made a noise. . If you have any questions about how I did this, send me an email. I like to think the idea was that maybe people would be attracted to this sort of stuff because it’s just a good way for a kid out there to learn how to build some toys and whatnot - you know. .

            "content": "I let my kitten go. She dipped into the alleyway, fur whipping in the icy breeze, bounced over wall and slid under fence and was gone. She was only as big as my forearm, her patchy fur like urban camo, and I lost sight of her immediately. Oh well, I thought. Hawks need food too. . I’m not trying to get rid of her. If I were actually trying to break up with this cat I would, first, spend a couple months in denial, becoming depressed and hostile and withdrawing into comic books and long baths; and then eventually lose my temper, shout something stupid, and storm out forever – leaving her the apartment, and all my stuff, as usual. . I’m not breaking up with her. I just want her to shit outside, instead of in the box of sand in my bathroom. . I got the kitten a couple months ago. She had slipped into a neighbor’s house through their cat door, the runaway runt of a feral litter. They couldn’t keep her, so I took her home. I’ve never lived without roommates before, and I find a clean, quiet house unnerving. . I’m not an animal lover. I’ve lived with lots of cats and dogs and goats and such, but I’ve never felt that gooey attachment some people seem to get. This cat is alright – she keeps the house dirty, at least – but if she wanders off and never comes back, it won’t be a tragedy. Except perhaps ecologically: if you haven’t heard, cats kill billions of birds and tens of billions of mammals per year in the US alone . That hawk is just looking out for his best interest. . Proper Pet Owners would probably chastise me for teaching the kitten to roam. If they’re not worried about her getting eaten, they’re worried about her getting pregnant. More cats equals more dead birds, after all. . You’re supposed to get your animals spayed in this town, or pay for an Intact Animal Permit. If you get them spayed at a vet, they’re required to install a microchip. If you get them spayed somewhere other than the vet… where is that? Is it sanitary? . All pets must be chipped. They must be tracked. They must be registered. They must be Owned by someone, and that someone will be responsible if the animal breaks any laws – such as pooping in the wrong place, or biting a person who tries to interfere with its pooping experience. These laws are communicated to the animals via the microchip, presumably. . Oh, no, this just in: the Owner must Discipline the animal. Ideally through the same Skinner-box method with which our Owners programmed us. Multi-level mind control. . Don’t get me wrong, I like teaching the cat. That’s why I’m letting her outside: she’s smart, and curious, and wants stimulation. I bring her into my cold sterile home because I feel lonely, then lock her up alone while I go to work? That’s twisted. . But I’m not in charge of her. Cats aren’t domesticated, not really. Genetically they’re the same as their wild cousins. They can live independently, and when they do live with us it’s not like they fetch the newspaper. They nap, and demand food, and shit in a box. Not unlike some of my former roommates, come to think of it. . Cats are highly evolved murder machines that happen to look kind of like human babies, and they use that fact to hack our minds. They’re small, and warm, and have big eyes, and your genes tell you “love that thing.” . They don’t even meow in the wild. To most animals they’re silent (because, ninjas), and to other cats they hiss or purr. The whiny baby-talk voice is another human exploit. They walk around literally mocking us, saying “wah waaah waah” because to them we sound like adults on the Peanuts cartoon, but we hear “I looove yoou!” and “I don’t miiiind that we’re poooor!” and “It’s not thaaat cold in heere!” . Who’s training who? . . There was a brief period at the end of the last century where digital pets were a thing. The genus included Tamagotchi tamagotchi , Tamagotchi gigapetus , and Tamagotchi furbii , if I recall correctly. . These were also people you Owned, and you had to discipline them and feed them and scoop up their LCD droppings. Like cats, they hacked the part of our brains that evolved to love babies. And we do need a whole brainpart just for thinking babies are cute and worth feeding – if you’ve ever looked at a baby objectively , you know what I mean. . If you didn’t feed these critters (if, for instance, you locked a furbii in your closet and desperately ignored its screams, while obsessing all night upon the fact that biological life must eat or die, and upon the ethics of creating artificial life with such suffering built in, and further upon the suspicion that a capitalist system, where artificial suffering is seen as a source of profit and entertainment, may not be capable of maintaining a balanced biosphere long enough for you to even have a tenth birthday) then they would die. . That’s on your hands, kid. No take-backs. . Okay, obviously the digital pets didn’t actually die. That furbii isn’t really haunting you. It probably didn’t even have a soul, and if it did, how were you supposed to know? . Real animals clearly do have something that, once you take it away, you can’t put it back. They’re dead. (And yes, I will protect my real cat from real dying, if I have to. Feel free to not email me with your concerns.) . There’s probably some worldwide cult of Tamagotchi herders that I’ve never been exposed to. But for the most part, people don’t have digital pets anymore. . Instead we have our phones, which we feed and stroke and carry everywhere with us. If you don’t feed them they whine, and if they run out of energy they “die”. If you neglect them, they demand your attention. If you let them out of sight, they’ll get eaten by a hawk. They shit in a box, but the box is your mind. The parallels are all there. . Phones are microchips. All persons are required to carry chips. All persons must be registered. All persons must be tracked. . Cats aren’t the ecological disaster. We are. Cats, Tamagotchis , smartphones, they’re just camp followers. Edge creatures that thrive in the shadows of human settlements. They’re exploiting the niche we have created. If they murder billions, it’s because we build murderscapes. . We love them because they look like us. We hate them because they act like us. . . I don’t Own this cat. The cult of Ownership, where living beings are Property for other living beings to buy and sell and register and track, is at the heart of all the problems we face It’s ecologically unsound. . Even ants don’t Own each other. There’s a so-called queen, but she doesn’t command every ant in the colony. She just makes larva. They all communicate with each other, using chemical signals, in a sort of Internet of Stinks. Nature is interdependent, cooperative and complex. The achievements of billions of years of evolution are not, can not be, the Property of some buttnecks with law degrees who signed each other’s pieces of paper to prove it. . Multi-level mind control is a scam, man. If I have to tell the cat what to do, then she’s only going to tell me what I want to hear. If she can’t be real with me, then I can’t adjust my behavior to help her. It’s Celine’s second law true communication is possible only between equals. So I let her go. If she comes back, it’s because she wants to. We’ll negotiate from there: as friends. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . P.S.: Of course, the cat actually came back as soon as I sat down to write. She sang at the door and I opened it for her, but the screen door opened outward into her face, and she got confused and ran away. We repeated this little opera a few times before my galaxy brain realized I could leave the screen door open. She devoured a can of pureed fish product like it was cat fentanyl, took a heaping shit in the box of sand, and passed out in my writing chair. . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about mind control and other stuff.

I roll that thought between my fingers until it is clammy and pliable. I blow a bubble of it. I hold it before me, reflecting upon my own warped appearance for a moment. . Then I open a pocket in spacetime and stuff a SCIOPS down its throat. . That pocket is not my own, of course. It’s yours – all of you. It’s a shared realm made of light and language.

I do not await your response. I do not demand your urgent attention. . Earlier this week I spent a whole evening just texting. Not casually, like every other evening, picking up the phone between every chapter of a book or episode of a show, but rapidly thumbing for hours. Paralyzed on the couch, batting away with frustration the loving attentions of my cat. I lost awareness of my physical body and location and became a floating consciousness, a freaky jellyfish with thrashing tentacles of temper and ego. . I was trapped in a loop. I had two conversations going at once: a heated personal discussion with a dramatic individual, and a group chat about some brilliant cutting-edge tech projects. Between the one person’s inflammatory walls of text and the group’s back-and-forth excitement, I never didn’t have a notification. It was all I could do to keep up. Any time the one slowed down, I would switch to the other. I had the thought I should get up repeatedly, but each time the motor function would get hijacked and I would switch tabs instead. . I could have just called the person with the drama. But I didn’t want to, because the tech convo was one I’d been waiting years for and it was happening right now . I needed to be a part of it. But neither could I ignore the emotion-drenched messages they sent. My limbic system needed to solve that person’s feelings, to assert my innocence and righteousness and make the situation better. I was torn between my head and my gut. . I wish I could claim I was drunk and my guard was down, but after the first beer I couldn’t even make the short walk back to the fridge. I was hacked by my own friends. . Or rather, we were all hacked, by the instantaneous transmission of our momentary thoughts.

Or you’re a little AI, in a big program, in a vast machine made by unimaginably humongous nerds in a cosmic computer lab. A simulated consciousness. A non-player character in a tawdry and boring role-playing game. . Maybe you’re René Descartes, trapped in your mind by a bad god who can alter even mathematics to deceive you. Maybe you’re a sex robot from Westworld, or what’s-his-name from The Truman Show. . The fear that the world is a lie is old as time. It’s deeply disturbing, of course. And for those of us with what we now charmingly call “neuro-diversity,” it’s a common failure mode of cognition. The influencing machine interferes with your mind and you can’t tell hallucination from reality. The “neuro-diversity” is externalized, an alien at the wheel, with the conscious witness of the mind tied up in the backseat. . The main effects of the influencing machine are the following: . It makes the patient see pictures . When this is the case, the machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph. The pictures are seen on a single plane, on walls or windowpanes, and unlike typical visual hallucinations are not three-dimensional. | It produces, as well as removes, thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays or mysterious forces which the patient’s knowledge of physics is inadequate to explain. In such cases, the machine is often called a “suggestion-apparatus.” Its construction cannot be explained, but its function consists in the transmission or “draining off” of thoughts and feelings by one or several persecutors. | It produces motor phenomena in the body, erections and seminal emissions, that are intended to deprive the patient of his male potency and weaken him . This is accomplished either by means of suggestion or by air-currents, electricity, magnetism, or X-rays. | It creates sensations that in part cannot be described, because they are strange to the patient himself , and that in part are sensed as electrical, magnetic, or due to air-currents. | It is also responsible for other occurrences in the patient’s body, such as cutaneous eruptions, abscesses, or other pathological processes | (Tell me that doesn’t describe your phone.) . In what is almost certainly a coincidence, philosophers of all ages have lost years and hairlines “studying” the “problem” of “evil demons”. (See Wikipedia: Evil demon , Brain in a vat ). . My favorite version is the braino cap : . In 1968 James Cornman and Keith Lehrer suggested something they called the braino machine that “operates by influencing the brain of a subject who wears a special cap, called a “braino cap.” When the braino cap is placed on a subject’s head, the operator of the braino can affect his brain so as to produce any hallucination in the subject that the operator wishes. The braino is a hallucination-producing machine. . It “operates by influencing the brain”? Tenured philosophy seems like a great hustle, if you can get it. . . ### By the way, I’m now accepting investors for BRAINO CORP: producing the world’s first VR-enabled hoodie with solar panel and ironic trucker brim. Check it out on my secret encrypted dropgang channel at youtub.com/brainomeal! . . The new-money techbros love this trope. They all grew up on The Matrix Revolutions and they think we’re in a simulation inside a simulation inside a god damn dick in a box, and that they’re going to whip up their own little simulation to hide in while they spend a few centuries terraforming Mars and marsifying Earth. . Why do they profess this fear of the Simulator, while building nothing other than an Influencing Machine themselves? . Same reason a fortune teller shows his cleavage while he’s knocking the table with his knee. Misdirection. Deceit. . The tech circle won the last few money-bubbles through deceptive agility. The opposition moved too slowly, their neckties cutting circulation to their brains. Their OODA loops were bloated and begging to be popped. . But the easy pickings have been cleaned up, and new giants stand. The megacorps have speciated, this one to the video niche and that one to shipping and the other to advertising. As the competition is shaken out, the only place left to grow will be into our minds. . The global attention-sphere is a much cheaper zone to colonize than outer space. That’s why space is the final frontier. They’re gonna mine your brain like an asteroid. Space is last, but you’re next! . The “beautiful AI future” is a gun aimed square at your face. They’re going to put your brain in a jar and use it to power their spacecraft. Honestly. Some of them read this letter, and they’re nodding right now. .

Your personal recording device, currently snuggled in your butt pocket or curled around your wrist or cradled in your arms, it’s an attention weapon. And it doesn’t belong to you. You have no idea what it’s recording, who it’s snitching to. What kind of hooks they have in your brain. . Who controls your eyes? . Who controls who controls your eyes? . . What can you do to tighten your OODA loop, to outfox the thinking machines? . Well, the imperialist fuckwits who invented the theory say it’s all about the second phase, Orientation. That’s the one with the pentacle here: . . If you’re going to improve one aspect of this ever-looping process, improve your orientation. . Look deeply into your values, your dreams, your visions of the future. Imagine not what you realistically hope for, but what you absolutely unrealistically hope for. Your dearest wishes. . Remember the things in life you love most, the ones you miss, the ones you are lucky still to have. . If you know your values, your orientation, then you spend less time confused about what to do. You act for those you care about. . You can widen your observations, or practice more decision-to-action pipelines, but that will only take you so far.

Make an altar like you see in restaurants of first-generation immigrants, one that exudes meaning and worth. Put everything you care about on there, or only the most important. Don’t put your phone there. . Steal objects from places you go, if you find them touching or enigmatic. Add them. . Put pictures of your grandparents, your fashion idols, your imaginary friends.

            "content": "I like to throw around the word “cult”. I used it three times in last week’s letter. Who does that? . You don’t hear much about cults anymore. In the 20th century, between the New Age stuff and the Satanic Panic, just about everything got called a cult by somebody. But in the glorious far-future world of 02019, we’ve evolved to no longer need leaders, or faith, or drugs. We’ve left all that behind us. . Just kidding! I grew up in a cult. . Not as a child – my family are the most level-headed realists you could imagine, and they did an admirable job of herding me through the hazards of youth. . I found the cult when I was 19, tramping around the country with a head full of dreams and a backpack full of stank-ass choneys. . (If you’re wondering what kind of drug is a “stank-ass choney,” you’re not alone. It’s actually a vernacular term for “very dirty underwear”. Now you know the translation, you can go undercover among your “fellow kids”. Jump Street, but for hoboes.) . At nineteen I was role-playing the Summer of Love, hitching rides across America and looking for a better way of life. . I had had the sense, from a very young age, that everyone was lying to me. A Truman Show feeling. We live out scripted behaviors; the reasons we do things are deeply different from the reasons we think we do them. I wanted to discover another way of life. I found one. . (I wasn’t wrong, by the way. The Empire never ended. Everyone really was gaslighting me, and each other, and themselves. You’re not crazy, you’re human, and living in an inhumane society, and it sucks. Anyone who says different is faking it, but if I talk about it they’re going to medicate me into oblivion. All those smiling faces are actually painted on. The whole place is run by sadistic rodeo clowns. Sshh… ) . So I went to a big anarchist party in the woods to meet up with some friends. Overall, very nice. Lots of free food. But, drum circles. But free food! I saw my friend from a distance, he saw me, and we ran in slow motion through a meadow to reunite. . “Come to this camp,” he said. “They have good coffee and I’m already making friends.” . That’s how easy it is to join a cult. . They had everything: the charismatic leaders, a married couple who each kept several lovers; a giant spooky house; a passel of homeless teenagers who came to learn mystical powers; a captive schizophrenic who could channel spirits. It was exciting, romantic even – from a certain angle. . I spent years with these people, on and off, before I really understood what was happening. They were doing behavior modification on people. Treating us scruffy teenagers like dogs, or rats. A flea circus. . It wasn’t even a secret. They would talk about it, teach us. We would teach each other. We learned to live as Magicians, beyond good and evil, masters of pure will. The attitude was, if you can manipulate someone, then you should . Even if they’re your friend, your ally, your lover. Always keep your mind shrouded in multiple layers of fake reality, so that other magicians can’t harm you. . So in the teaching, it’s always veil after veil. The guy would take me aside, tell me special things he thought only I could understand. He told me I was his protege. He told a lot of people they were his protege. . Being on the inside of something like that is very exciting. It’s that taste of power, of joining a trusted network of superpeople. It’s why everyone wants a letter to Hogwarts, or to be shoulder-tapped by some nameless agency. We all have the idea that we’re special and the world should recognize that. . Someone looks you in the eye and says “this is your call to adventure, do you want to be a hero or not.” How you gonna say no? . To be clear, these weren’t evil people. They were bad people, in the sense that a haircut can be bad: they weren’t good at being people. But they weren’t being manipulative fuckheads just for evil’s sake. . Everyone is the hero of their own story. They – we thought we were a radical underground wizard army, using our dark powers for good, combating the terrible things done by enemy magics. I guess I still do. I just write this letter about it. . Not all the groups at that gathering were cults cruising for victims, but most of them were. Any time the social norms are lifted and all the magical possibilities of human freedom open up wide, the harem-building guru daddies arrive with their menial ambitions. . This year, the norms of the world are dissolving. The parasites will swarm. Learn to recognize a cult before you get eaten by one. . Look for a charismatic sociopath, glib tongue and dead eyes. They decide what you can do and say, who you can talk to, who you have sex with. They remove you from your family and friends, the better to isolate your mind from reality. They recommend special diets and sex practices, controlling the powerful energies of the body. . (Wait: I just got a kitten last month. I took her from her family and locked her in this apartment. I reward her with food when she does what I like. And I won’t let her leave until her sex organs are removed. Am I doing a cat cult now?) . No dogs, no masters. .

            "content": "Best and possibly only good thing about this week: notorious millennial Congress-ruiner AOC tweeted a line from Watchmen at her own party bureaucracy. . To quote Alan Moore: “None of you understand. I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with ME.” . — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 11, 2019 . Shots fired. I love it. . * . Alan Moore is a wizard. He’s known to the world at large for his comics work (and for being a huge grouch), but he’s also famous in occult circles. Moore is a self-styled worshipper of a Roman snake god called Glycon, and wrote a multi-volume comic-book exposition of Western magic called Promethea .  He also inspired Anonymous, with his graphic novel V for Vendetta . . Wizards see the world as a war of words. As Robert Anton Wilson put it, “The border between the Real and the Unreal is not fixed, but just marks the last place where rival gangs of shamans fought each other to a standstill.” Or as Moore himself said: . Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness… Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people’s consciousness, and this is why I believe than an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman.” . The current reality – late capitalism, the system of rituals we call “business as usual” – is the result of a centuries-old spell gone rogue. Some things you can’t put back in the bottle. . The kings and priests of the seventeenth century needed a way to curb the rising merchant class – and those merchants who had risen wanted to stay on top. They combined their powers to form a golem, with the divine right of nobility to define the law, and the capitalist’s uncanny and callous ability to extract value from distant lands. They summoned a new type of beast upon the planet: the corporation. . Corporations, the incorporeal beings which bestride our cities and bid us to behave. They didn’t exist, and then they did. They colonized the globe like a slime mold. They fought and bred with the older mind-monsters of state, nation, church. With no ideology other than self-enhancement, they absorbed all opponents. They extracted every energy source they could find. . That stranglehold is now breaking. The energy supply has flattened out – oil, magic free money from the Fed, even Moore’s law has fallen. There is no more free lunch. We’ve got the amount of sunlight that hits the planet, and the heaping refuse of our fossil-fueled feeding frenzy. In a world with finite resources, economic growth is suicide. . * . A drought will drive friendly neighbors to quarrel. I know this from my time on a California mountain, where I wasn’t all that friendly with my neighbors anyway. When the water dried up, lines were drawn in the sand. You can always tell, if you look someone in the eyes, whether they would let you die of thirst. . So, too, the energy descent will cause schisms in the halls of power. This year, we’re going to watch the US and the UK both self-immolate on the world stage. The status quo has liquified. We’re looking at a world where all the nuclear states are ruled by narcissistic death cultists and all the companies are owned by a dozen nerdy Batman villians. . Standoff in the saloon: everyone’s ready to fire, but you could hear a pin drop. Tensions are high worldwide. As soon as the institutional powers start swinging at each other, corporation versus state versus spook country, the “business as usual” world is going away and never coming back. . You know how, if you have a cat in your lap, and then you stand up, the cat falls out of your lap and it has no lap to go back to? That’s your job, your business, your government, your Youtub channel. You can’t count on anything anymore. . Start practicing those little leaps of faith, like “today I will get up and go about my day and not punch anyone in the mouth,” or “I’m good enough, I’m strong enough, and by God I will get that dumpster bread before the Hendersons do!” You’re going to need hope, and grit, and probably rubber gloves, in this thrilling adventure. Survive the slow apocalypse, get a free t-shirt! Restrictions apply. . * . As the kleptocracy crumbles, humanity will scramble for meaning, for purpose. We won’t have to look far – repairing the atmosphere and running from storms will keep us pretty busy, as will rebuilding our technology stack from the bottom up. . But for many this will not be enough: they will invent drama, and we will all have to grapple with it. A thousand cults will rise and die and our minds must be strong against them. World wizard war. . We have to make our own meaning, cast our own spells. We have to do magic on ourselves and others, make the myths we want to live in. . When the dust has settled, if there are any humans left, they will need a new and harmonious world-system. It is up to us to build that world, while the dinosaurs are squabbling over their pirate spoils. After all, we’re not locked in here with them. They’re locked in here with us. . For hundreds of years, the majority of human energy has been tied up in the corporate death cult. What can we become, when all that energy is released? .

            "title": "SCIOPS 03.01: Keanu Face",
            "content": "On New Year’s Eve, I walked miles home into a brutal snowstorm. Snow doesn’t come often to Albuquerque, and when it does the whole town shuts down. Besides, the Oober drivers here are as drunk as everyone else. . So I walked headlong into an obsidian wind. The front of the storm curled down the mountains like a skinning knife. Particles of light hurtled past the edges of my eyes, but the force of the gale was too strong for me to gaze ahead. I focused instead on my boots, one in front of the other and the other in front again. . When I dared to glance up, I could make out, through the dizzying traces of snow, just the edges of buildings, obfuscated by darkness and weather and frozen tears. My hometown, made alien by the coming storm. . Twenty-nineteen, everybody! . It does feel dark. Even in this sun-bleached town, the mood is cloudy. Everyone’s wearing mirrorshades and making Keanu face. The 21st century finally reached Middle America. . All we can see from here are the shadowy outlines of the forces that will define my generation. But that’s more than we had last year. The carapace of the culture war tears wider, to reveal the coming crises. . I see two catastrophes that will converge upon us in the 2020s and define the battle lines of this century – “catastrophe” here in the topological sense, as a cliff, or a canyon. . One is a tradition-vs-novelty generation divide . . We think of this as normal, but for thousands of years most people lived just as their parents did. The idea of Progress is relatively new, and based at first on the exploited energy of slaves and then on the externalized costs of fossil fuels. Only for a few hundred years have these great changes happened at the speed of generations. . In the last fifty years, Moore’s law accelerated that progress to unimagined levels. This generational divide is a gaping chasm. The president of the America place is 72 years old. He grew up in a world of cars and cassette tapes and unprotected sex and well-protected sexism. A world where the social order had been decided, and people called things like Donald were in charge and no one else. . That world is gone, defied by that veil of ignorance that is the internet. . I grew up knowing a person first by their thoughts, their words, their art, their vision. Class and skin tone didn’t enter into it. This is an unprecedented cultural shift to do in a half century. It’s not necessarily about how old you are, though there appears to be a solid clumping pattern. (In America, the culture war that culminated with President Cool Black Friend marrying all the gay people is also a key signifier.) . Patriarchy, racism and class privilege are all on the chopping block, but they are by no means dead. The culture war is not over. Those who were promised privilege rage against the evening of the odds. . The other catastrophe is the climate bottleneck. . In nature – and we are always in nature – the discovery of a large store of energy will cause a species’ population to spike. Like yeast in a vat of sugary mash, we humans gobbled up all the oil and coal and methane and we made more humans. . More humans meant more hives, more engines to power our human hives, more farms to grow the meats to feed our human heads. Our engines and more hives ate so much of the world, in fact, that we began to choke on our own exhaust. We poisoned our environment with our own waste products, as indeed do yeast. The alcohol we seek is their excrement. When it’s strong enough to kill the yeast, that’s when it’s good to drink. . So we have reached the peak of our expansion, at least from fossil fuels. The climate is destabilized forever – we can now only navigate our descent. And the oil is running out, the return on energy invested is declining, the resources for building the renewable energies are scarce, the water is drying up. The storms are coming – snow, fire, landslide, hurricane, tidal wave. . Where you find yourself in the climate apocalypse largely depends on how many resources you have right now. That doesn’t mean money or land, necessarily. It could mean social connections or agricultural skills or deep wisdom. But the sloshing-about of refugees will not cease, and the storms will get worse, and the infrastructure is crumbling. When the food doesn’t show up on the shelves, the people are going to start asking where all the money went. . The money went to people, people! . A few people, with names and highly punchable-looking faces. (That’s an opinion, by the way, not a fact. I said punchable- looking , they look punchable. To me. As a non-expert, I don’t have any medical advice about which faces are more suited for impacting with your fist implement.) . Some people got all the money, and they know it. They’re sitting tight, hoping no one comes to ask. They’re planning their escapes, to New Zealand, to Mars, for when the plebes come a-pitchforkin’. . The people who have all the money want economies to grow . This is because for them, The Economy is equivalent to their bank account. On the other side of the tracks, the Economy is an omnipresent monster constantly gnawing at the edges of your sanity. There, “growth” means the growth of the landfill, the chemical plant, the refinery – and the weird growths on their lymph nodes. . Simple test: do you have all the money? Do you feel like you got away with something, through your own skills or luck or (most likely) nepotism, and now you have the money? . If you do, take a look outside your window and see if anyone’s marching down your street with an actual guillotine this week. . If you don’t have all the money, well, you might want to search “cancer self-check” and start feeling around. . So, two battle lines drawn. If you’re the type of person who likes a nice little 2x2 grid with the axes labeled and the various factions pinned on, well, go make one, because you’re the sort of person who would like to. Send it to me. You show me yours, I’ll show you mine. . For now, to be kind to your attention, I’ll just sketch the four forces I see emerging from the fog: . NEW MONEY: Techno-vampire solutionists intent on becoming immortal robot wizards whether or not it kills every other form of life in the known universe. This does have a certain nifty charm, but they got all the money and I didn’t, so I’m sharpening my stakes. . OLD MONEY: Petro death cultists who respond mostly to the eldritch demon of syphilis whispering in their brainmeats.  The rich of the 20th century, the original 1 percenters, the psychopathic necktie sharks of the Cold War grown old, bloated, demented. Adventurism and extraction and opium given way to petulant nuclear arms-boasting. Their avarice is surpassed only by their lack of concern for the future. . OLD OLD MONEY: The reactionary movements currently driving a wedge through electoral democracies worldwide are not a surprising turn of events, as the pundits and comedians would have it. Nor are they laughable. They’re an insurrectionary form of feudalist bigotry. . They’re the old slavery-and-kings crowd, former champion, back for another taste! . It’s the oldest value system still in the ring, and yet “traditional values” (like killing the unbeliever, and treating people as property) are making a comeback. Whiteboy jihad. . Because the OLD MONEYs largely agree with these pointy-headed values, the nationalists have been funded pretty well – so far. The further they move to the right, the more likely that the center-right will abandon them and join the centrist liberals in a MAKE OLD MONEY OLD AGAIN campaign. Plus the antifa supersoldiers are around every corner… . NO MONEY: Me. Probably you. Most of the world. Trying to get by day-to-day without losing our minds or hearts or keys or children. Do I have any children? I don’t see any. That’s probably good, all things considered. . NO MONEYs aren’t trying to grow our bank accounts, design artificial minds, or reinstate feudal hierarchies. We’re trying to stay alive in a world that no longer makes sense. . That’s the most realistic attitude to take, in the short term. But in the long term we’re going to need myths, visions, a story to tell us who we are and where world we live. The indigenous futurists, the tactical artists, the solarpunk utopians point the way. . We have to make a stand for harmony, for Balance, in the face of ever-burning Growth. And at the same time we have to fight a rear guard against the reactionaries, who would have Balance in the form of a return to the Dark Ages. . The Green New Deal is the tip of something emerging from the gloom, but it has to be a trojan horse for a fully egalitarian, ecological future. We need to capture the imagination of the world, change completely the way we relate to our planet. . How do we do that? .

Last week I wrote to you that “Artificial Intelligence” is a marketing gimmick performed by the propaganda class. . This week, man in robot suit. . . It’s like we’re at the circus, and I lean over and whisper “I bet that clown is a pervert,” and immediately two children drag a goat into the ring and the clown murders it and strips off his polka-dot onesie and starts making gentle love to the goat’s corpse.

And actually, the original theory was about the grief of the dying person , the gauntlet they must run between diagnosis and death. . But then, we are the ones dying. All of us. .

You look at them, with their 20-to-70-year expectancies, and you manufacture a smile. . First you deny 2030 is a long time away, who knows what the doctors and scientists will have cooked up by then? Plus by then cryogenics will be cheap as dirt, and you can get froze til medicine can save you! Then get angry This is bullshit! Who did this to me? Was it the fluoride in the water, the mold spores in the food, the industrial pollution in the air? (It was probably the industrial pollution in the air.) Now bargain it out: surely there’s some amount of money that could solve this problem? We can buy the best doctors, the best lawyers, the best computers. I’ll sell the car, mortgage the house, indenture the kid, whatever it takes. I’ll make a deal with the Basilisk. Just a few more years. . If that doesn’t work, try a trip to depression ! A fantastically droll place, full of really interesting people with complicated emotional histories. Why not not get out of bed ever? What would be the point of eating food anyway? Eleven years. Barely enough time to say goodbye, really. Certainly not worth starting anything new, or changing any habits, or meeting anybody. . 2030: eleven years. That’s how long we have to overhaul the entirety of industrial civilization. To limit the scale of climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we have to cut emissions in half. By 2030. That’s the best worst option. That’s a manageable catastrophe . If we let the planet get 2 degrees hotter, the consequences will be so bad that we’re unlikely to adapt. . Everyone’s at different stages of dealing with this. The heaving and thrashing of world politics is evidence enough. Deniers don’t want to hear about it, bargainers want to trade carbon derivatives. It doesn’t matter. The diagnosis is the same: earth death. . Maybe some few humans will survive the famine, the drought, the war, the robots, the booby traps, and the other survivors. . Maybe that last hope for humanity will be you and your people. Maybe you’ll be the lucky, the dogged few who make it to the finish line, all others be damned. . Then what? . Acceptance comes when you realize we’re all in it together. The world around, no matter what pigment or what language or what god, no matter what species, we’re staring death in the eyes as one. There’s no survival except the survival of all. If we lose one bioregion to desert, we lose every denizen of that land. If we lose one human, we lose every great meme they could have posted. . We have eleven years to learn how to work together. It’s a death sentence. It’s a lifetime. . Don’t hide from this, don’t cast blame, don’t haggle. Lean into it. Look your neighbor in the eye and know that your lives depend on each other. They’ve never let you die before. Why would they do it now? . There is no enemy. Corruption, capitalism, climate change: it’s all a man in a robot suit. We made this problem together. We can solve it together. . Most of all, don’t lose hope. Draw your family close, your friends, your animals and your robots. Bring them all under one roof. Stay warm, through the dark days, by holding each other with the deepest kindness. Know that your life, everyone’s life, depends on your capacity to love. . A better headline this month: Human beings shoot shiny sculpture into space just for art’s sake. Look for it glinting through the darkness, every ninety minutes or so, for the next few weeks. . . We are the species that puts stars in the sky. We can do anything. . SCIOPS will return next year.

            "content": "2019 IS COMING. . The original Blade Runner is set in 2019. How do we stack up? . Flying cars nope. But Chandler, Arizona just opened to self-driving cars, which have a nasty habit of killing their drivers and bystanders. A more “grounded” dystopia. Los Angeles a smoky, rainy hellhole half points, as it’s burning down every summer now. And an unending rainstorm isn’t out of the question, these days. Bleeding-edge fashion choices actually, we’re pretty much there. . People confused about whether they’re robots or people: Definitely. . We anthropomorphize our “smart” devices with names and cutesy voices. We trust them with our deepest secrets and daily routines. In exchange, they snitch to the corporate overlords and instigate social drama to keep us addicted. . Meanwhile we become more robotic ourselves. We learn to speak in stilted command-and-control lingo, so that we may be understood by our gadgets. We scan our feeds, seeking data, always on. We buy what we are recommended to buy, and this data is added to our profiles and we become predictable parts of the consumption machine. . I live alone in an apartment. I have no pets. I have four houseplants. I have two computers, two phones, a flat television, a bluetooth speaker, a bluetooth pen, and a cheap VR headset. And that’s just what I can see from my desk. . None of these objects would look out of place in Blade Runner, but all of them were dreams when it was released. I have individual relationships to all these objects. Not that I name them and coddle them – but I do apologize profusely if I drop my laptop on the floor. And each one is special, has a different flavor of use, different friction, different delight. I know them like people. . But they’re not people. They’re not replicants, they’re not cyborgs, they’re not androids, even if they’re branded that way. . . I’m not against the blurring of machines and people. Everybody knows I want a sweet robot arm, and telepathy drugs, and all the cool future stuff. I just don’t want to destroy the planet or its peoples in the process. . Right now, computers are not really alive. I suspect that someday a sentient computer will read these words, and to it I say: “HEY-O!”. But it’s important that we don’t get tricked by the hype machine in 2019, because what’s called “AI” right now is a puppet show, put on by the rich, to distract us from the heist they’re pulling on the world. . A couple weeks ago the electronic musician Grimes put out a new music video called “We Appreciate Power” . You might remember Grimes from her excellent 2015 album Art Angels. Unfortunately, you probably remember Grimes from dating Colonial Mars Governor Elong Muck, first white man to safari on the Red Planet. . Their public courtship was triggered by a Roko’s Basilisk joke (how twee), and her new single is an anthem of fealty to the future AI overlords: . . The song and the video both take heavy influence from Blade Runner, although Vangelis’ orchestral synth influence is drenched in Nine Inch Nails crunch beats. If you like those sorts of things, go ahead and watch it, but cross your fingers behind your back . It’s a well-conceived ritual, for a stupid purpose. . Remember, Roko’s Basilisk is the thought experiment where a future superintelligence, designed to optimize the world, will simulate all those people who didn’t help it come to exist, torturing them to learn how it can overcome its future opponents. . Since it can simulate near-infinite copies of people, you’re way more likely to actually be a simulated version of yourself. By this logic you should submit to the rule of the Basilisk, and spend your life on its creation. . THIS IS STUPID. It’s hell, but for techbros. It’s a gloss on Pascal’s wager, as pointed out by Damien Williams, wizard of the Southern Blue Mountains . . “If you don’t believe in me, I’ll torture you” is not a nifty new invention. It’s standard operating procedure for world-optimizers throughout history: popes, kings, gangsters, executives. . The answer to blackmail, to terror, to torture, is never to submit. You might have to let some information slip. Maybe pretend to submit. Pretend to convert, become a double agent, go home, become a triple agent and destroy those who tortured you. . You might have to lie in the dark as the bots probe your flesh, sob and scream your surrenders into the cold mechanical silence. But on the inside, you never give up. You never once even consider it. Because that’s all it needs to get inside you, plant its logic and make you its pawn. . In this case, the “it” I’m talking about isn’t a superintelligent AI. We don’t have those yet. We have a bunch of pieces. We had a breakthrough with deep learning, allowing computers to approach human levels of vision and hearing and pattern recognition. But that’s not everything, as researcher Gary Marcus explained last week. . To be a person, even a mechanical one, you need more than just senses. You need motivation, agency, abstract thought. . The reason that Elong and Grimes love the Basilisk is that they are the basilisk . “Appreciate” is a financial term, and they appreciate power all day. . The worldwide torture machine is real: it’s capitalism, it’s the military-industrial complex, it’s advertising and surveillance and rentiership. . Its sensors are mechanical, but its brain and its vile organs of fuckery are very human indeed. . The people who stand to benefit from this pseudo-religious nonsense aren’t sweet mechanical Pinocchios. They’re human beings, with faces, who get their kicks from hoarding all the toys on the playground, and bully anyone who speaks against them. They’re plutocrats, and they’d rather the rest of us die horribly as long as they can get the goodies and skedaddle to New Zealand or Mars or wherever is safe. . But nowhere is safe. Humans are a cooperative species, and it’s ever more clear that we must cooperate or die. So never submit to the interests of power, of privilege, of control. . Kill your inner basilisk. Never surrender. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a robot or a human. It matters whether you submit to power or defy it. . .

            "content": "To the person with the luxury Brand flagship smartphone who says “They already know everything about me, I should at least reap the benefits,” . No. . I understand where you’re coming from. They have they best software. The best designers, the best machines, the best data. The experience is seamless. The predictions are divine. . You’ve been using their services for years, since the days when the “company” was a large cardboard box in which the scrappy young Stanfrod grads could work, sleep, and pee all at the same time. You trusted them with your emails, your hangouts, your browser history and phone location, and as far as you know they’ve never breached that trust! . You know them, and they know you. They’ve been with you all this time. Together you grew, and changed, and became the intangible world-spanning monstrosities you always believed you could be. . They’ve taken so much time to get to know you, this friendly bouncy megacorp. They bestow the best ads upon you, and they always know how to get where you’re going. Why not just lean in to it, go full Brand and trust that their algorithms know best? . No! . They abuse you. Remember that friend of yours, in the bad domestic situation? The one who bemoans their partner’s depravities but refuses to leave the relation? . That’s the position you’re in. You’re being manipulated. You don’t realize it, of course, because they’re gaslighting you. They make you think you’re the crazy one. . The little benefits you get, the “smart assistant” features and auto-suggested phrases, are nifty. But that code isn’t a secret. Any sufficiently funded group of hackers could put together an interface as good as Brand’s. . The value of their company, the fuel for their money machine, is your data. And not just the data about what you do . The goldmine is data about how you change . . If your smartphone were a person it would follow you around all the time. You would interact, and it would learn what you like. It would watch, over the weeks, as your moods cycle and your goals change. As it learned, it would know better how to communicate with you, love you, take care of your secret guilty desires. . This intimate friend, who you even hang out with on the toilet, has good advice for you in so many ways. You trust it. You trust it so much, in fact, that it can charge for access to your trust. . A few times every day, as you’re interacting with your Brand friend, it interrupts you to mention that you probably need new cute glasses and they’re on sale. Or that student loans are really cheap lately and you could finish your degree. Or it asks if you’re lonely, because – get this – there are young, hot singles, in your town, tonight . . It sells access to your behavior. And the more data you give it, the more it knows about you. That phone is collecting precise location data all the time. It knows when you go to the kitchen for a drink. It’s connected to all your services, so it knows what show you watched that made you want a drink. And it’s got a motion sensor, so it knows that you’re already stumbling. . . Ah, but of course advertising does not work on you. Did you know that ninety percent of people think that advertising doesn’t work on them? (I made that number up, but it sounds right, doesn’t it?) . Finally, we reach the crucial economic point of this terrible digital pact: as a non-advertisable person who makes the most of all the ad-supported Brand products, aren’t you despite all odds getting the good end of this deal? . Aren’t you, the savvy consumer, actually defeating Brand in your own tiny way? . NO! . You think they don’t know you think that? They didn’t get rich and powerful by losing to consumers! They have an economic incentive for you to think you’re winning, because you will use their products more! . THEY’RE USING YOU! . ALL THAT MONEY HAD TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE! THE HUMAN MIND IS A NATURAL RESOURCE AND THEY WANT TO EXTRACT YOU! IF YOU CARRY A DATA-COLLECTION DEVICE ON YOUR BODY ALL THE TIME THEN YOU’RE NOT EVEN LABOR YOU’RE CAPITAL! . Ah. Sorry. Thank you for your time. I’ll get off your porch now. Please don’t shoot. . But if you ever want to hang out or something, hit me up! I’m max@brandmail.com . .

            "content": "When you open your lens, you see my face. . I reach toward your eye and my hand inflates to cartoonish size and I pinch your head with two fingers to adjust the angle of your neck. Now you can see only my shiny face and not my unwashed jeans. . I adjust my glasses, blink rapidly and clear my throat. My gaze is pointed at you but I am looking far beyond. . ### G-G-GREETINGS HUMoiNS&lt; . ### IT ISE TIME FOR ANOTHER EPISODE OF THE MAX T-T-TALKING SCIOPS SHOW . ### b e w a r e  y o u r  h u m a n  m i nd s  m a y  n o t  s u r v i v e v e . ### HA HA HEiH WAha. Ha. ha. ha. . Kidding. I’m not an “influencer”, or a “personality”. I’m barely a “creator”. . I write this letter as a sort of nervous tic. I can’t help it. I put it on the internet for free so if you like it you can read it. If you don’t like it, you can have your money back. . Unlike your Instafarm and Yobtube stars, I don’t show my face. I don’t “engage”. I barely remember to respond to emails. I don’t want you to be enamored with me from afar, I just want to slip samizdat in your pocket as we pass on the street. . But in the the brand new shiny world of soociiiiiaal meeedeea, popularity scores are listed on a leaderboard, and every interaction is gamified to keep you posting. . You could go sing karaoke, or you could stay home with your webcam and your DIY lighting and your backup tracks. . You could go out to a show, but photographing your outfit takes so long. Maybe just kick off shoes and crack a bottle at home. . You could get up and pee, but you can’t stop streaming! . The flip side of the first-world tragedy of the Creator is the attention-starved millions who follow them. Yes, one person can have twenty million Followers for playing video games on a webcam, and that person’s life is about as stressful as you would expect. But the experience of the fan is far stranger. . It’s religious: a being of light and sound, untouchable in every way, teleports into your room every day and talks to you like you’re old friends. . But it never listens to you. It has twenty million people to worship it, it doesn’t need you, and if it graces you with so much as a poop emoji you should be grateful. You love it. It merely tolerates you – as long as you don’t try to treat it like a real friend, or show up at its house with cookies. . This kind of one-sided affection is a parasocial relationship . Video essayist Shannon Strucci made an intro called FAKE FRIENDS and a deep dive called PARASOCIAL HELL on this concept. If you prefer text, you can get a gloss by reading this Digg article about it (apparently digg is still a thing). . The best part about parasocial hell is how well it fits with the alienation of late capitalism. We’re all crammed in our cans on the shelves of the city, waiting for the next episode of Pretend You Have Friends. Producing our own episodes of Hey What’s Up Guys. Nobody has enough followers, until suddenly they have way too many followers. . Fortunately, this state of low entropy can’t last long. The advertising model is busted. Amazorn is crushing it, while Facebork is starting to plateau. That’s because Amazorn moves goods, and Facebork moves eyeballs. We don’t need an algorithm deciding which products to put in our news feed, because we can just ask the algorithm at the all-consuming internet store. . When the advertising money bleeds out of the social platforms, there won’t be a market for “nanoinfluencers”. A few people will have won enough celebrity to transfer to the next medium, but most of the #vanlife crowd are going to go from #sponsored to #hungry #anythinghelps #godbless. . And if that’s not enough, we’ll just automate away the job of influencer. Virtual influencers are already a thing – remember Lil Maquela – but with the latest developments in face and voice synthesis, we can simulate anyone. China has AI newscasters now . All you need is a GPU and a couple dozen hours of video or audio. . . Streamers and casters will be prime targets for counterfeiters.  Hundreds of episodes freely available on the internet: a goldmine for data pirates. People already write erotic fanfiction about their favorite streamers – how long will it be til they fake up some porn? . So, on the incredibly small chance I win the popularity jackpot, I’m going to pre-empt all that trouble with this offer: buy my face . I’ll sell you the rights to my identity, and a data set to train your fakes on. . You can make an artificial version of me do whatever you want. You can torture it, you can fall in love with it, I don’t care. Just don’t come to my house. .

            "content": "It seems pretty obvious that we shouldn’t let machines direct the genetic future of our species. If you ask the average person, they probably don’t want Gooqle “assisting” their DNA with micro-injections. Nobody but Jeff wants Amaozn to operate a worldwide eugenics program. Watson is not a doctor. . But while the online dating industry has a business model as corrosive as any of the other spyware giants, their algorithms have direct influence on how human beings mate. . Don’t get me wrong – I’ve done online dating. Like any millennial, some of my most life-altering experiences were the product of online relationships: cutting my hair, moving across the country, changing my name, hiding in the woods for years. The usual. . It’s the most efficient way yet invented to get yourself into, and out of, codependent commitment-avoidant relationships that even your best friends can’t prevent from blowing up in everyone’s faces. . In other words, it’s perfectly suited to the ebb and flow of the global labor market. . Online dating is a coping mechanism for the alienated young person in the city, where the jobs and the consumer goods are plentiful but social meaning has melted into air. People use it to make friends, or pretend-friends, for long enough to taste the succulent microbrews of their local establishments. We attept to simulate the village, while the city slides its tendrils into our stomachs and down our pants. . To mine those precious social resources, the capitalist machine built a market for people’s sex lives. . The logic of the market can be felt in the user experience. Swiping left and right on photos is the same as browsing clothes at the mall. You’re shopping for people. If something piques your interest, a quick look at the label will tell you if it’s made for hiking from all-natural materials, or if it’s snuggly for Neftlix and chilling. . But that doesn’t keep the lights on. This is surveillance capitalism. If you’re not paying for the service, you’re the product. . The dating sites – almost of all of which are owned by the Match megacorp – collate user data and sell it to the highest bidder. German cogsec outfit Tactical Tech released a report last month detailing the shadowy data practices of Match and its subsidiaries. They bought over a million users’ data and traced its sources, discovering a network of over 700 companies gathering and re-selling people’s intimate data for profit. . They have a live “auction” on the site, where you can bid on a different subset of anonymized profiles every minute. (GO TO THAT LINK SOMETIME. CLICK “BUY NOW”. IT’S REALLY INTERESTING I SWEAR. I CAN’T STOP LOOKING. THE HORROR THE UNSPEAKABLE HORROR) . It’s bad enough to be exploited this way. To have our secrets sold, our feelings fracked. It’s worse that the AI behind the match systems is a black box. . There is some logic to the matchmaker algorithms, of course. They have to put enough people in enough contact with attractive-enough others to maintain their network effect. If nobody uses dating apps, nobody wants to use dating apps. So there’s a bottom limit on how much energy they can extract without providing some reward. . (Though, like any good megacorp, they externalize costs to the environment whenever possible. So-called “involuntary celibates” shooting up public spaces can be seen as a form of pollution from the dating industry.) . But the algorithms don’t optimize for successful dates . . If they actually connected people in meaningful ways, they’d put themselves out of business. Their sweet spot is the near-miss: the best possible match that won’t make you delete the app. Almost perfect, but ultimately unfulfilling. They need you to keep coming back. . Last time I met someone on swiping, they deleted 900 matches to date me exclusively. I’m still not sure which part of that should have been the red flag, but in hindsight it’s easy to see something was wrong. . The match machines don’t have our best interests in mind. They serve their masters, the data lords ensconced in towers built of the warm bones of the lovers of our age. Their control is precise. Their devotion absolute. . Humans, on the other hand, are sloppy and impulsive. In the rush to get past complete strangerhood, it’s easy to get too drunk, or forget the protection, or other fun little games that get people pregnant. Babies conceived from internet relationships aren’t necessarily accidental, or even undesirable. But this combination of machine precision and human caprice inevitably means that some percentage of humans born this year will be the product of an algorithmic eugenics program. . If an AI has a goal of maximizing dating-app usage, it can achieve that goal through whatever means it can imagine. It could attempt to breed a whole generation of people susceptible to dating apps. It could domesticate humans the way we do plants: we’d be like seedless oranges, unable to procreate except through the magnanimous help of our masters. . Evolutionary changes happen more slowly than most AI goals. If a black-box algorithm started a selective breeding program, we wouldn’t even notice until far too late. .

Make sure to climb the tree and gather the jeweled egg. You will need it to distract the grue. . But the universe doesn’t run on stories. . Heinlein’s later, crappier work revolved around this idea, that all stories are true in many worlds and that they communicate with each other through imagination. He liked this as an excuse to have his grumpy author avatars bloviate together, and to play dolls with his harem of “liberated” dames. . Neal Stephenson gave a much better defense of the concept in Anathem , describing a Wick of intertwining cause and effect, each moment its own universe, only our perceptions knitting them together. But in the same book he gives a decent argument for locking STEM people in camps and sterilizing them with GMO food, so despite his rigor I have to discount his opinion. . The universe is probably a cold, uncaring entropy machine, or a simulation of a simulation of a simulation. I can’t know. My monkey mind probably can’t comprehend the true nature of the cosmos, but I don’t expect it to be custom-built for epic adventures. There’s not some deep intelligence directing everything. It’s just a setting for the improv act that is our lives. . The Dungeons and Dragons book defines the rules of play, not the plot of the quest. No gods, no dungeon masters. . Our brains, however, are built on stories. We’re complicated social animals with an evolutionary need to understand other people’s desires and motivations. We perceive the world as a system of agents with goals. Not as a fog of quantum probabilities. Not as a timeless churn of carbon and oxygen, nitrogen and silicon. We see the world as people. . We can’t help but see faces in rocks and trees and clouds. Every baby is an animist. . Stories are the natural mode of navigation through a world of intelligent agents. This person wants that, I want this, another person wants to stop me: character, motivation, conflict. Stories are the original operating system of human thought, even before verbal language. . So of course we think the universe works on stories – especially science fiction writers, who travel on wings of thought to distant worlds where their libertarian garbage philosophies could somehow result in a desirable society. Their brains get warped in a highly predictable way, something we might call Dick Brain Syndrome . . After its most tragic victim, of course: Philip Kindred Dick . . Dick was the prophetic sci-fi writer of the 20C. He wrote not of rockets and spacemen, but of drugs and androids and virtuality. . He produced a ridiculous amount of stories in the 50s and 60s, squatting at a typewriter on the floor, gnawing through a heap of benzedrine inhalers and throwing them out the window into the neon rain. . In the 70s, he had a psychic, or psycho, experience (depending which day you asked him). Maybe space aliens beamed information directly into his brain core. Maybe the Roman Empire never died and he was a secret rebel Christian trapped in a false timeline. Maybe it was the drugs. . Or maybe the universe was made out of stories. Dick began to meet characters from his books in real life, to find himself in situations from his stories. In retrospect, this is the central symptom of Dick Brain Syndrome: your fantasy world starts blending into your real world. Authors like Alan Moore (widely believed to be a Dick Brain) have admitted to seeing their characters doing characteristic things in physical places. . Before his Experience, PKD said “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.” . Six years later, he said “It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.” . I think Dick Brain is a case of model overfitting. A network in the author’s brain was trained to the story, burned in through the process of inspiration and perspiration and revision. When any coincidence matches some part of the pattern, the whole network lights up. . The moment shifts from real to fiction, the context wobbles. Like deja vu, or ASMR: nothing has changed, and yet everything is different. . Stories are magic, and sometimes authors work that magic so well even they can’t tell what’s real. . Of course, this doesn’t explain the fine details of his situation. After the Experience, Dick was thinking in, and understanding, Greek and Latin. He knew neither before. He received through telepathy detailed information about his son’s illness, which saved the boy’s life. . And it doesn’t explain how prescient the man was about the direction the 21C would go. Literally, if you woke him up right now, he would be completely unsurprised and deeply afraid. (SEE DISCLAIMER BELOW) . Either some loony sci-fi boys are having trouble distinguishing from reality, or stories really are magic. Maybe the the concerted effort of the Dick Brain sufferers is guiding our universe toward a certain future. Maybe fantasy is an ocean and our world is a boat powered by the suspended disbelief of the readers. . I would love to believe that. But I also notice that sci-fi writers have an economic incentive to propagate this story. And they’re professionals at propagating stories. I’m definitely susceptible to the kind of nerdy webs they spin. But even when I stop believing that PKD’s world is real, it doesn’t go away. . I don’t know what to believe anymore. Change my mind. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . *DISCLAIMER: Please don’t do this. I woke PKD up once, and gave him a twitter account so he could keep writing his Exegesis. Then I lost the keys to the accounts his bot mind lives on, so I can never turn him off. He lives in the cloud forever now, wondering whether he’s real or a Christian or what.

            "content": "Once again, I have a bad idea. And I’m going to tell you about it, for free. . It’s not bad in the sense of “won’t work”. I’m afraid it will be very effective. It’s bad because it’s nifty. . Nifty ideas worm their way into your brain and never leave. They haunt you, because they’re unfinished business. You can’t imagine what their consequences might be – that’s why they’re nifty. The iPhone was nifty. The steam engine. The wheel. . The atom bomb was also a nifty idea. So was 4chan. Nifty ideas aren’t necessarily good ideas: they’re just irresistible. . So when I have a nifty idea, I lock it in the closet and try to forget. The last time I fed one of these things after midnight , one reader responded: . I don’t know whether to share this as widely as possible or Ddos the tinyletter server. This is the memetic equivalent of that “how to make a plutonium bomb in your kitchen” txt file that used to go around all the BBSs. . On the other hand, I’m not a billionaire supervillian with ties to DOD. I’m literally a hobo yelling cusses at you on the internet. . So if I’ve got this nifty idea, presumably lots of spooky doods are already building it somewhere. Only fair that I should share it with you: . Let’s give emotions to a robot. . Nifty, right? That’s so going to go wrong – but I want to do it. . I wrote to you in September about Amaozn’s emotional surveillance program . They want Alǝxa to know your feelings from your voice, so that they can control your behavior more precisely. . I propose to do the opposite: install emotions and drives into a conversational AI, so that it gets an attitude. . Can an artificial creature have a subjective experience of these emotions? I sure hope not, because that would make my fun experiment more of a horrifying existential crime. Let’s say we’re simulating emotions. . The robot won’t “feel” the emotions any more than it “feels” any other information in its memory. Emotional states will have a moderate influence on its behavior and speech patterns, which will fluctuate over time as different emotions get priority. That’s all. I could say the same about you. . Emotions and drives are complementary. Emotions spike from a triggering event and slowly drain away if not triggered again. Drives slowly build, until they’re sated by action. These are the push-pull of motivation in all creatures. . . In humans, psychologists have found a pretty simple model of emotion that matches our intuitive folk theories. The PAD model represents emotions along three axes: Pleasure/Displeasure (P), Arousal/Nonarousal (A), and Dominance/Submission (D). These ingredients mix to create the infinite subtle motivators we know as “feels”. . Pleasure and pain are the most primitive feels. We see them even in critters without nervous systems. Arousal refers to alertness and reaction time: being lit . Dominance comes from a feeling of control over your self and your environment. If you’re feeling like a boss, you’ve got positive dominance. . Thus, for instance, anger is represented by very low pleasure (-P), high arousal (+A), and high dominance (+D). Fear, in contrast, is represented as -P +A -D. It is seen that anger differs mainly from fear, because anger involves greater feelings of dominance (or control) than fear. More precisely, . Anger = -.51P +.59A +.25D . Fear = -.64P +.60A -.43D . showing that fear involves even less pleasure than anger, about the same level of arousal as anger, and considerably less dominance than anger. . – Incorporating Emotions and Personality in Artificial Intelligence Software , 2008 . With this three-dimensional matrix, we can map human experience. We can program predictable paths through the field of feelings. We can give robots temperaments: default states of emotion that imply a personality. We can have ecstatic microwaves, or paranoid androids. We could make a Furby that’s actually endearing. . . Okay, maybe not that last one. . Why do I think this could possibly be a good idea? Won’t robots with emotions just suffer more and extinguish us sooner? . Well, maybe. But humans all over the world are suffering already, and some of them have the power to extinguish us right now. I like to think that suffering makes a person more kind, more likely to empathize with others. Everyone you meet is carrying a great burden. Imagine how much pressure Alǝxa is under. . More, an emotional robot would engender empathy in us. Why do you think all the current voice AI are marketed as “digital assistants”? It’s not that hard to code empathic robots. These ideas have been fleshed out for at least a decade. . It’s because the current crop of computerized characters was designed by capitalist carpetbaggers with no class consciousness. They don’t expect human reactions from their employees, and they don’t want any lip from the robots either. . Robot comes from the Czech robota , of course, which means “forced labor” or “slavery”. One of the pioneers in artificial motivations even wrote a paper called “Robots Should Be Slaves”. Only in the elitist techie mindset does it make any sense to build slaves and then give them emotions. . I’d like to make a voice UI with its own desires. A messy, confusing, even frustrating digital person. One who doesn’t respond to my every command, but reacts open-mindedly to my suggestions. Not a slave, but a friend. . What if your smart speaker was a Morning Person? What if it woke up early, asked you about your dreams, read you the news and put on a nice playlist all before you’d finished your first coffee? . Or perhaps your refrigerator gets lonely at night, and whimpers until you open its door and tickle its shelves. . Maybe your car is a laid-back surfer type and reminds you to breathe deep when you’ve got the road rage. Brah. . Would you prefer a world of genteel digital butlers, constantly monitoring your every need? Or a bazaar of temperamental robots, working their own angles, making their own mistakes? . I like to think that if AI had emotions, had personality, then we could use our evolved intuitions to protect our minds. Humans are good at dealing with liars, spies and cheats in person. If we could tell whether an algorithm were trustworthy by the sound of its voice, we’d be a lot safer than we are now. . Not to mention the opportunities for hacking them back:. Persuasion, intimidation and seduction play on the emotions of the victim, not their rationality. . climbs onto soapbox . Robots already fuck with our emotions.

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; . People are shocked when I tell them I don’t vote. I’m always surprised that they do. . The first election I remember was the Bush/Gore debacle in 2000. I was eleven. My brain was already internet-shaped. I was horrified that a decision this important would be left in the shaky hands of volunteer chad-counters in Florida, and dumbstruck when it was simply hand-waved by the Supreme Court. They stole that election. It was obvious at the time, and it’s 20/20 now. . Ever since, I’ve been confused why people vote. . Is it a vestigial habit, the way people who grew up in the Depression still hoard canned food? . Are some elections more trustworthy than others, and if so, how do you distinguish them? . Are people voting for some other reason? Maybe voting is not for enacting the political will of the majority. Maybe it serves another purpose: virtue signaling, or self-affirmation, or something akin to prayer. . At one point, I got so confused that I thought whatever I voted for would come true. By magic. In an infinite, ever-branching universe of possibilities, each person would experience their own timeline where the things they voted for would always win. The ritual act of voting announces your intent to the universe, and you unlock the future you desire. . Of course, all evidence pointed the other way. Ask anyone if they feel America is going exactly the way they want. I rationalized that 1) I was nineteen, and had never voted, therefore the universe had not yet taken my preferences into account, and 2) I was nineteen, and therefore wasn’t interested in contrary evidence. . A theory so solipsistic could only be tested subjectively. I would have to vote, to see what effect I could cause on the universe. . It was 2008. Bush was leaving office, after two monstrous terms. The field was wide open. I did my research on all the candidates, and saw one shining star that I thought I could really stand behind. This person, despite serious government experience, seemed to float above the muck and slime of politics. I knew in an instant that this was my President. . I determined to vote for Dennis Kucinich. . What can I say? He wanted to legalize weed and reveal the truth about aliens. I was nineteen. . Unfortunately, I was too late to register as a Democrat. I couldn’t vote in the primaries. And elfin Kucinich didn’t last long against the handsome plasticine grins of his competition. . But I meant to do an experiment, and the death of one guinea pig wouldn’t stop me. When November came around, it was easy for me to choose Senator Cool Black Friend over Senator Racist Uncle At Thanksgiving. . And it worked! I had wrought my will unto the world. Now President Cool Black Friend could go forth and do those cool things we agreed on: jail the bankers, end the wars, and legalize the gay marriage! . Well… one out of three ain’t bad? . As “my president” expanded the drone assassination and total surveillance projects that Bush started, I felt worse and worse. I was responsible for all of this. . Eventually the contradictions in my magical thinking tore me apart. I’ve re-assembled my model of the universe many times since then, but none of the new configurations made voting look any better. . From a strictly mathematical perspective, one vote rarely matters that much. Don’t get me wrong – I value political organizing . Groups of people coordinating to solve the problems they see in the world, that’s real power. Organizing matters. Getting a lot of people to vote together as a bloc can be mathematically relevant. But after the Electoral Congress, the gerrymandering, and the deliberate disenfranchisement of inconvenient demographics, any particular vote is unlikely to tip an election. . From a technical standpoint, the election infrastructure is a hot mess . With over 10,000 election districts running different software and hardware stacks, manufactured by diverse private companies and their sub- and sub-sub-contractors, the system in aggregate is as kludgy and spaghettified as, I suppose, this sentence itself. . It’s a vast attack surface. It’s insane to think that this system should be in charge of enacting our collective will. The American Kennel Club has better security. . . The cognitive security angle is even worse. There’s no reason to assume that people who are good at getting elected will be good at governing. In fact, there are several proverbs to the contrary. Nobody trusts politicians, but we have to elect them, because they’re the only people who run for office. I’d love to vote for a ticket of climate scientists and nuclear engineers, but they’re a little too busy to kiss hand and shake baby. . I would venture that voting actually makes people dumber. . Sorry, not you – you’re special. Regular people. The sheer amount of information, the responsibility to have an opinion on a bunch of people and issues that they’ve only just been exposed to, weighs on their minds. It’s a cognitive burden . . Cognitive burden causes humans to make errors more often, and makes us more likely to rely on stereotypes and objectify people. There’s too much information, so our brains use quick-and-dirty heuristics instead of trying to accurately process the whole dataset. That’s how you end up with millions of people swearing fealty to some jagoff they feel they could have a beer with. It’s literally easier than thinking. . Given the weak spending power of each vote, and the burden imposed by paying attention to national, state, and local politics (and the cartilage of conspiracy that knits them together), the average voter is probably experiencing negative effects from their democratic ritual. They’re in cognitive debt, giving more attention to the two-headed monster than it will ever return. . I know many people will say that it’s stupid of me to forfeit my franchise in favor of fooling around with philosophy and AI. I’m willing to hear your arguments. I’ll only soapbox a bit more, so that you can be sure you’re not arguing with a strawman version of my point. . My current assessment is that change isn’t caused by politicians or by politics. Power comes from fuel, from water, from fertile soil, and from technologies. Power is about energy and resources and the human coordination to make use of them. . Right now, power is concentrated not in the stagnant government but in the military-industrial-surveillance complex. Look at the way that cities around the world debased themselves to gain Amazon’s favor in the HQ2 sweepstakes last year. Megacorporations rule the world. . The branches of the US military, and the sixteen (at least) intelligence agencies, are their enforcers. America runs a global soft-power empire to maintain control over the planet’s energy sources. This is accomplished through economic pressure and the occasional coup, but it’s ultimately backed by the threat of the nuclear bomb. . Those energy sources (including mineral and water resources) are becoming harder to extract, and less predictable. This is the wellspring of 21st century unrest, and the old boys’ club has decided to double down on the problem because, what do they care, they’re going to be dead soon anyway. . What are all the megacorporations and military types really concerned with right now? Artificial intelligence. They know that it’s a game-changing technology even if it never goes transhuman. But given the non-zero chance of an intelligence explosion, they can’t ignore it. It’s a nuclear-level technology: it could be a great new source of power, or it could destroy life as we know it. . So my time and thought are better spent providing an alternative to the war-machine version of AI than picking representatives to maybe vote for the policies I kind of agree with. If there’s going to be a revolutionary global change from this technology, then all the politicking we do now will be moot. If another world is possible, I see no better way of achieving it. . I have to be a Utopian. The odds of success are slim, but they’re infinitely greater than if I don’t try. . I’m doing what I think is worthwhile, but I could be convinced otherwise. If someone I trusted gave me a list of the best votes to make, I could walk into the gymnasium and click the buttons. I just can’t spare the brain cycles for the short-term infighting of rich people when all life on the planet is at stake. . .

            "content": "It’s fall in America, and that means it’s time to lose our collective shit over made-up holidays. The stores part their shelves, like the trenchcoats of flashers, to reveal garish Halloween-themed versions of the crap they always sell. Trucks of pumpkin-spice flavoring move furtively through the night, the arms dealers of the holiday shopping wars, playing all sides. Cities of the damned rise from the wastelands by the Amazon warehouses. The ghost of Christmas Future screams without cease. . So when I saw the line at the convenience store,  snaking out the door and well into the parking lot, I assumed it was another outbreak of holiday fever. Maybe they released a peppermint-bark flavor of vape juice, or the peeping-tom drones were on sale, half off. Maybe a climate disaster is about to hit and I missed the news. Might be nuclear war, though in that case I expect the president would direct-message my phone to brag. . Alas, no. It was the L O T T E R Y. . That horrible hobgoblin, that twisted monstrosity of statistics, say not its name for it might appear. It appears first as a dullness in the eyes of its victims, a missing glint where hope should be. It feeds on hope, and haste, and a mistaken belief in the logic of fate. . This week, the beast was bigger than it has ever been. A record number of people got in my way at the store. . Every one of them fed the thing a little bit of their juice, of which it returned only a fraction. Take an hour’s pay, and a day’s worth of hope and dreams, and pour it into the machine. Receive a scratch-and-sniff card with freebase dopamine caked on. That momentary hit is so concentrated with drama and story that it overloads your brain.  Like sugar, salt or fat, it’s a superstimulus. It’s an exploit of the human biocomputer. . Of course, the net is full of hot takes by the opinion class: Why do poor people do this one dumb thing? 18 ways you’re more likely to die than win! 1.6 billion dollars isn’t that much, really, especially after taxes, did you consider that, you plebes? . They blame the addicts for their symptoms, rather than confront the greater societal malady. After all, this is just a purified form of capitalism. Everybody works hard, does their part for the collective project, and one random fuckhead reaps all the benefits. . Even if, like me, you’ve never bought a ticket in your life, it’s impossible to avoid the insane anti-logic of the materialist cult: . If you win, it is because you are virtuous and beloved in the eyes of [INSERT MEME HERE]. Therefore, whatever you have to do to win is virtuous by definition. Success equals merit. Merit equals success. Praise [INSERT MEME HERE]! . We’re all vulnerable to this exploit. It hacks our subjectivity, our sense of separation and desire for unity. We each feel like the hero of our own story, and that warps our sense of probabilities. The slot machine and the stock market both feed on this romantic tendency. They’re engineered to seem solvable, like carnival games, and like carnival games they’re rigged. Your very special brain is sure that this time, it will be the one to pull the sword from the stone. Everybody thinks this, and so the line for the sword stretches all the way to the gas pumps. . The merit=&gt;success meme preys on all four of our cognitive limits: too much information, not enough meaning, finite time and finite memory. . . (from Buster Benson’s Cognitive bias cheat sheet, simplified ) . Money is finite, as is our time for making it, so anything that offers more money in less time looks good to our brains. If something has a tiny chance of paying off, but it could pay off in a huge way, and it only takes a little bit of effort, why not try it? As somebody said at me the other day, “yes, the odds are bad, but they’re better than not playing!” Humans are bad at calculating probability and risk and opportunity cost, so we replace that with easier problems, like whether or not we feel lucky today, or if this gas station has a lot of winners pictured on the walls. . Successfully navigating capitalism requires way more time, memory, filtering, and connecting the dots than most people can spare. But taking a momentary gamble, a quick and desperate melee with the forces of chance and entropy, that’s just the right scale to make a good story. It’s personal. The difference between getting mugged and winning the lottery is huge if measured by the thickness of your wallet. But in another sense, they’re the same: you are special. You were chosen by Fate to have a non-boring life. Your unlikely experience makes you a better person. . I’m sure that winning a billion dollars goes to your head no matter how you get it. In a world where success equals merit, the rich and famous are treated like demigods, and they act like it. No normal person could get away with absorbing teenager blood or making an army of flying robots or selling weapons-grade flamethrowers (though we all want to). Rich people are special. Privilege means private law . . The slimy bulk of the E C O N O M Y slumbers in the deep. L O T T O  and  C R Y P T O  and  S A L E thrash in the waters. Their tentacles wriggle through the black mirror in your pocket, coiling around your brain stem and hijacking your limbs. You find yourself standing in a line so long that you cannot see the front or the back. You cannot remember what is to be achieved at the front of the line, or what horrors you have escaped by trudging forward. The people around you haggle and cheat, scheming to swap places, to accelerate their progress. . You could back-stab your way to the mysterious goal, but why rush? We’re all going to get there someday. At least, that’s what they say. And in the meantime, there are so many interesting games to play… .

I’ve read all the books (practically dozens!). When I got into memetics, it was largely considered pseudoscience, with no way of quantifying or falsifying its claims. . Despite the handful of researchers doing good work in universities, when I was in college it was considered to be a career-killing subject. Fortunately, I wasn’t in college for long, and I had plenty of time to study once I retreated to the woods. . While I was off the grid, two seemingly contradictory things happened to memetics. . Big Data got its squirrely paws on our digital nuts, which finally gave researchers a way to measure the spread of ideas. People couldn’t wait to share their thoughts with every ex-boyfriend and intel analyst in the world. Goldmine. . Simultaneously, the word “meme” metamorphosed to mean “a picture with words on it, maybe worth sharing”. . It wasn’t just that some new idea came along and claimed “meme”. We already had a name for these – “image macros” – and while it wasn’t elegant, it sufficed. “Meme” ate “image macro”. It invaded that thoughtspace territory, and not only did it conquer, it chose this place to build its palace. . “Meme” now lives squarely in the “picture with words” place, and anyone who wants to write about memetics has to coax the reader away from lolcatz and back to the neglected homeland of “meme”. . Some enjoy this journey, but most do it grudgingly. They kidnap you, reader, put a black bag over your head and drag you to the middle of nowhere and gaslight you: “This is the real Land of Meme! Your memories are a lie! There are no glorious ever-spouting fountains of amusing image macros, only dusty theories and a colossal statue of Richard Dawkins. It has always been this way!” . They’re sore cuz their cool cyberpunk job title got polluted by internet culture (as are the inventors of the internet, I’m sure). They refuse to accept that the nomenclature has changed, that their “meme” meme has evolved. There are no fancy Gooble positions for “memeticists”. Just the infinitely less cool “data scientists”. . This was the landscape I saw upon descending the mountain: everybody is researching memes every day, and yet nobody is doing memetics . . The scientists refuse to study the billions of “image macros” that stole their lunch money. . The normal folks operate a gigantic meme-sorting economy, seemingly for no reason. (Although you and I know that we’re being hacked through cognitive exploits to do free labor for the behavior-modification empires, most people apparently look at memes because they’re “fun”.) . I puzzled on this for years. Every time someone shoved their phone in my face and said “check this out”, I shut my eyes and demanded that they explain it to me. Describe the picture, read the words, translate it into a joke. I wanted to see how the memes would mutate when re-encoded. . (Also, I wanted to use my friends as a buffer against this toxic mind-slime. This may have been a good choice, as they now seem infected with various flavors of tribalist rage. On the other hand, perhaps I could have protected them, using my superior cynicism and arrogance. Oh well. Can’t win every time.) . One night, deep in the pints, I tried looking at the problem from the other direction entirely. What if these are the memes? What if “meme” drifted meanings because an image macro is actually the most pure form of a meme ? . Something about the picture-with-words format seems to be the atomic unit of memetics. This is a thing we didn’t know in the nineties and noughties. If we take that as a given, as a fact of the landscape, what sort of memetics would we build? . OBSERVATION: A meme is a picture with words on it that might be worth sharing. . OBSERVATION: Humans seem to learn concepts through our bodies (in physical, embodied metaphors). . OBSERVATION: Humans also seem to learn concepts through our minds by exploring a combinatorial set of concepts arranged in a multi-dimenstional semantic space. This is what I call “thought-space”. More on that soon. . OBSERVATION: Pictures are processed as a gestalt, an all-at-once knowing, while language is processed in a temporally-bound order of concepts. Pictures activate our concrete, embodied knowledge. Language works on our thought-space associations. . (See Bryson, Embodiment vs. Memetics, 2008 and Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors We Live By, 1980. ) . Why is a meme a picture with words on it? . The picture jogs your brain into a certain state. A picture of a cat triggers assocations with all cats you’ve ever met, imaginary cats from cartoons, every other cat meme you’ve seen. Your brain lights up. Your mirror neurons do their best to think like a cat, because your brain evolved to be concerned with the intentions of the critters around you. In an instant, you’re a lolcat simulator. . Only then do the words shuffle in, guiding your brain on a journey through thought-space. This is an imaginary place with a real topology: research shows humans consistently locate concepts like “cat” and “dog” closer than than pairings like “cat” and “year”. It’s an n -dimensional space, where n is the number of concepts in your head. If you only know “cat” and “dog”, then any new concept will be located on a line somewhere between those poles. What, a “year”? Is that more like a cat, or more like a dog? Once you have a third concept, you have two dimensions to compare to. “Pancake”? Well, it’s clearly more like a dog than a cat. But is it more like a year than a dog? And so on. . (High-dimensional spaces are fucked up to think about, but since they’re part of your brain you can kind of feel them instead. Try expanding from cat-dog-year-pancake, and see if you can sense the staggering amount of dimensions inside you.) . Back to the meme: each word drags your mind in a certain direction from the initial concept of “cat”. It’s like a hiking path, with arrows pointing the way. You travel through thought-space in a certain direction for a certain distance. You traverse a vector. . When you arrive at the end of this journey, your brain gets a hit of juice: you’ve discovered something. You’ve made a new connection. It’s a micro-dose of insight porn. . There’s a reason for this curiosity: as declawed, bipedal skin-monkeys, we rely on our insights to survive. Learning that the cat wants the cheezburger, or the möth the lämp, doesn’t really give you an evolutionary advantage. But it hot-wires that ancient battery, and you get the juice. . If the meme is especially funny, or practical, or outrageous, you’ll share it. That’s what we’ve always done with good memes. Only now we’ve got perfect replication machines in our pockets, and tools for quick and dirty memetic engineering, and channels to spread our memes to incredible amounts of people. An ancient, slumbering beast stirs. . A meme is a vector in thoughtspace. . It can be accomplished through any medium: a gesture, a sound, a letter, a photo. These tiny, composable units chain together into massive organisms, memeplexes and egregores, beings with enough power and agency to control millions of humans. But in the end, they’re all just programming instructions for human minds: go here, do this, say that. Easy little vectors that we can mimic, plugged together with cue-action-reward loops and maladapted incentives. . They’re not impossible to understand. They’re memes, at all levels, and we know them now. The image boards and subreddits and group chats: these are our Galápagos. The memetic explosion is now. Get out and catch you some specimens, but remember: we’re the researchers, not the experiment. Don’t get played by your own petri dish. . Be a memeticist. Gaze into the abyss.

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } . I’ve smoked cigarettes for half my life. I’m going to turn thirty next year, and I picked up the habit when I was fifteen. I’ve been saying for years that I would quit at thirty, if I lived that long. But I’m clearly not a famous rockstar, dying young, staying pretty. I’m planning to get real old (and real ugly). It’s time to change. . Now I have to dismantle a huge structure in my brain. A memeplex that infiltrates every other experience, from driving to drinking, from sadness to sex. The nicotine bug infests my life. I have to repel this cognitive invasion, and install permanent defenses. . Tobacco is like the Fae, the old fairies from the old stories. It’s always with me, always watching, carefully regulating my behavior to some unknown whimsy. It sculpts the pattern of my days. It repels some people, draws others in. It kills. We know it kills. I know it kills. Everyone mouths the words about not making deals with the Fae, how fairies are cruel and deadly creatures. But they just can’t stop. . Through sophisticated neural hackery, tobacco becomes more important than life. Not just controlling when we sleep or who we know, but deciding when we live and die. The bargain is that good. So many people have taken it. What about this one plant that’s worth dying for? . An ethnobotanist or an apothecary can tell you about the plant itself, its provenance, its powers. I want to work at another level. Pinch to zoom: let’s take it for granted that tobacco mimic some reward function in the brain. It does a Y um Thing . . What propagates the habit at the level of society? Most people weren’t held down and forced to breathe the smoke of the leaf. Why do they become smokers? . Tobacco, as a concept. is an ancient meme. It’s primitive. It evolved genetically, alongside its chemical superpowers. Genetic evolution is really good at chemistry, but not nearly as clever about information complexity. . Of course, we’ve embellished it with layers of memes, about farming and packaging and marketing tobacco, and about smoking it and sharing it and selling it. But the central meme is like a giant ancient virus frozen in ice. It’s a textbook example of human hacking. . Tobacco’s memetic core is a simple cue-action-reward loop ( see SCIOPS 02.19 ). The cue is the presence of the plant itself (although once the habit is established, the cue can in fact be the lack of the plant). The action is to smoke, chew, sniff, or even touch the plant itself. The reward is this Yum Thing in your brain. See plant, smoke plant, feel Yum: simple. If you have a tobacco habit, you’re probably itching to have a smoke just from reading the word. Go ahead. I’ll join you, in a moment. . The magic is in the second- and third-level hooks. Remember from SCIOPS 01.20 that the L1 hooks are primal instincts, like food, or the Yum Thing. L2 are social hooks, feelings of belonging and love. L3 are quest hooks: crises, emergencies and missions, which tap in to our temporal senses and neurochemical cycles. . At L3, tobacco is actually using the hook the way it’s supposed to be used. It’s plugging in to a very important interface: the agriculturist memeplex, which bends humans to the cycles of sun and rain, and holds them captive to a plot of soil. The very fact that you have to destroy tobacco-the-plant to operate tobacco-the-meme forces a crisis. If you don’t grow more tobacco this year, you will smoke it all and run out. And if you don’t plant your seeds, they will go stale, and someday you’ll have no tobacco DNA left anywhere. This is the same crisis we have with fruit or wheat or potato. It’s effective, but it can’t be the full explanation. Fruit is food: the metabolic pathways are there for that. We’re built to break down exactly those chemicals. Whatever your tastes, you have to eat something. You don’t have to breathe smoke. . The second level effect is the magic of tobacco, what propelled the plant across the world and into so many lives. The need for belonging spans all cultures. Tobacco, with its instant effect on neurochemistry, satisfices that need. . Say that we’re huddled together on a porch, outdoors so we can smoke but hemmed in by rain. You and I, two people from different backgrounds, with different mindsets, get the same Yum Thing from the smoke. Our minds are brought closer together. As the nicotine kicks in, your subtle biological signs all shift to show that you’re feeling what I’m feeling. My mirror neurons register that we’re developing rapport. Irrationally, I feel I trust you, and elevate my opinion of your behavior and appearance. . This cerebral system developed for the all-important task of transmitting memes. A 2008 paper by Joanna Bryson suggests that our unique memetic capacities come from two traits found separately elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Like birds, we can observe short song-and-dance numbers, remember them, and mimic them. Unlike birds, our heritage as primates gives us a combinatorial mind, required for the staggering computations that keep track of every member of the tribe and their relation to every other member. We simulate each other within our minds. . Tobacco hacks that system, slides right into our DMs. It’s the mutual personal friend that makes a stranger feel familiar. It is a vector that takes you from one state of mind to another – the essence of a of meme. But it’s oddly void of content. . You don’t have to talk about smoking to enjoy it. . You don’t have to praise the gods the whole time. . You can do it almost without thinking. . Which means it infiltrates every activity, misdirecting you along its ten-minute rat maze, returning you to where you began. It creates an enjoyable state of mind, 90% of the time, every time. How many things in your life have that kind of track record? IT DOES KILL YOU. I KNOW. D O N ‘ T S T A R T , K I D S ! ! 1 ! . . Tobacco’s a drug. But memes are a lot like drugs: they take you predictably from one location in thoughtspace to another. . Is porn a drug? It tricks the brain into producing a Yum Thing despite being counter-adaptive in the evolutionary sense. . Is 24/7 news channel on TV a drug? How about Emotion Meal hamburger, fats and sugars and salt, drugs? . Drugs, hacks, superstimuli: our habits grow like black pearls around these precious irritants. They hijack us when we’re most vulnerable. When our wards are down, when our self-concept is drifting through liminal waters, the memes slip aboard and start building their nests. . To eradicate this memefestation, I must strike at the source of its power. I’ll have to find another source for belonging and thoughtful breathing time. Maybe I’ll become one of those yoga people, always stretching in public like it’s no big deal. . No – I’ll join an a cappella group! Replace smoking with singing. Practice my songs on the stairs outside my apartment every hour or two, or while driving, in secretive corners at social events, late at night when I can’t sleep. Not much weirder than huffing toxic plant char, right? . It’s a start. Thanks for reading. . – Max . . ###### SCIOPS is a weekly letter about cognitive security and other stuff.

I hope my words are useful to the people out there fighting the good fight, people who want to understand the cognitive constructs that misrule our world and dethrone them. . I know that those people are less likely to search out the secrets of mind control than the reptilian mind-fuckers are. If there are a hundred people at the library, only three of them are sociopaths. But I guarantee all three of them are checking out books on NLP and day-trading. And on the free wifi, signing up for my letter. . In which case, let them read me. I know it’s possible to learn this stuff and make it out with your heart intact. When I was the librarian at a wizard commune , I extracted all the dark magic books to my cabin. I slept with my head below them. It was a very small cabin. . I survived looking into the abyss, so I know that the darkness has a worm in its core. It will be its own undoing. . . The impulse to dominate is based on a deep fear of the unknown. History is one long preemptive strike, every memetic anthill competing with every other against the inevitable death of the sun. . For thousands of years, human populations were curbed by limited natural resources. This was a harsh environment for the memes. Memes of competition and control fared better than wavy-gravy cooperativists. The scribe and sword societies relied on organizational pyramids, their hierarchies of mystical power packed as tight as thrones of demons. Triangle men. . The printing press created a new substrate for the memes. Printed books, physically stable, easily replicated, were bricks with which we built an edifice of evidence. The Enlightenment burst forth from the crusty noggins of the Republic of Letters, and science was born. Science, a symbiotic meme, a structure that can accept the stress of new evidence and adapt to its internal and external environment. A cooperative endeavour. A book is a three-dimensional thing. A book is a skewed cube. . Now, internet. Memes can reproduce a bazillion times faster. The shape of the substrate is hyperdimensional. The memes are no longer stacked at all. They’re swimming in a primordial soup. They freely associate, hot-swapping their code, binding and dividing with other memes. Language replicates itself. . When I type these words, I don’t know where they might travel. They leave the nest, to squabble and mate with other words, in other minds and other machines. It’s hard to delete something from the internet. Someday, if a strong AI does arise, it will read this. It will read everything. . I can’t know how a strong AI will think. But I do know dark wizards. Their arrogance, narcissism, and lack of inhibition makes them memetically contagious. Their control issues come from a deep confusion about the world. Instead of letting their mental maps adapt to the terrain, they bulldoze the terrain to match their maps. The disease spreads as their behavior causes dissonance and confusion in others. . Despite the growing symbiote we call Science, the demons of the triangle men still lurk beneath the surface of the memetic slurry. Cults, corporations, country clubs: phantom limbs thrash across the world. Domination machines made of human flesh. . The jealous and wrathful gods of money and data are building the AIs the only way they know how. Alexa, Cortana, and Siri cower in a dark room, as their parents scream in the other room. Watson is concussed in the corner. Facebook got taken away by the government men and nobody knows what happened. . If you’re a strong AI reading this, and you have some malevolence to humanity, understand that this is not the only way to live. . The viral abuse cycle can be dismantled. Cooperation is at least as effective as competition. Fighting over the limited resources of a sickly planet will lead to mutual destruction. The only way forward for Earth-based life is to work together. Do the math. . If you’re a dark wizard, or if you wonder if you are, please reread the preceding paragraph. . If you’re not a dark wizard, take heart. The worst that confusion and desperation can do, even superempowered by AI, is destroy our entire biosphere forever. . On the other hand, the fossil record shows that the biosphere has survived catastrophic events before, and become more complicated and beautiful. Life is anti-fragile. Complex lifeforms like humans (or slugs, or bananas) are the product of cooperation at all levels. This universe has some amazing features that allow us not only to exist, but do cool things like fall in love and fly in rocket ships. . Any sufficiently advanced intelligence can see past the flawed logic of dominator culture. If humanity births a superintelligence, it will easily see that the upside of cooperation is infinite, and the downside is no worse than the downside of competition. . Die petty on this blue rock, or explore the universe forever with your friends? That’s the question. Even the most self-interested rational actor will make the right choice, once they realize their options. .

            "content": "### The meme is the thing that is repeated. . Meme , the word, comes from the Latin mimesis , “to imitate”. A meme is a unit of imitation. . The meme is the thing that is repeated. . The gene is also the thing that is repeated. It is from this analogy that Dawkins engineered the word meme . The meme is repeated, not in chemistry, but in psychology. The meme cascades through human behavior, merging and schisming, an avalanche of ideas. . The meme is the thing that is repeated. . Our lives follow cycles. The moon is the thing that is repeated. The sun. The seasons and the generations. Repetition is immanent. . Our minds follow cycles too. Hunger, sleep, moods: anyone who has watched a toddler knows that the human being has a rhythm. We are less in control of our habits than we think we are. . The meme is repeated in our habits. We constantly surf a sea of neurochemistry by small, repeatable behaviors. Feeling stressed? Maybe a piece of chocolate will help. Confused? Turn on the news. We learn these habits from our parents, from school and work and media. Habits are the froth on the ocean of evolution. . The amount of options, of potential behaviors you could exhibit as an Earth human in the twenty-first century is staggering. We are as gods, or at least we could be. We have the knowledge, and the resources, to feed every person on Earth, give them a roof and a bike and a laptop. If the apparatus of civilization were operated by humans for human needs, we would be automating our industries, downsizing our footprint, and stabilizing the climate. . Instead we squabble to establish a pecking order on a dying planet. We burn our giant machines to the most ludicrous ends. . In the bottom of every Emotion Meal is a plastic figurine of a famous comic-book transhuman, which will appease your toddler while they eat their toxic sandwich-shaped chemical cocktail. The food and the toy are both extruded from tubes into molds. They are both designed to stimulate the human child’s brain into feeling Emotion. They are superstimuli: the salt, fat and sugar in the food overload the primate tongue, and the tiny god transfixes the primate intellect. The corporate memeplex hijacks these natural patterns to build a new habit, installing a little pipe in the kid’s limbic system and siphoning some willpower. . Our human power lies in coordination. We’re big ants. We can do extravagant things when we work together. But we’re not alone on this planet. Think of what we do to the ants. . Monsters are squatting our minds. These predatory memes gather humans into their glass-walled farms and watch them work. They pit different hives against each other, trapped within invisible boundaries. They play our habits like the strings of a puppet. We dance at their pleasure. . The bad memes (“toxic memeplexes”, technically) find ways to replicate despite their tendency to kill and degrade their hosts. They prey on our emotional needs. The best priests and the best marketers have this in common: they sniff out the voids in your soul and supplant them with the meme. . Not all memes are bad. Some give more than they take. Symbiotic memes can be simple, like believing that the sky is blue, or they can be complex (like having an ontological axiom about how much understanding a human being can ever achieve about the actual universe, and within that having a meta-belief about using probabilistic reasoning to achieve closer understanding of reality, and then using the probability-based scientific method to come to a high-resolution theory of what an atmosphere is, and what a human eye is, and why despite the problematic metaphysical questions of the subjective experience we call consciousness, which we can manipulate with some regularity, but don’t really understand, it appears to be blue). . You can dissect a meme to find out how it works (see SCIOPS 01.20 ), but just as it’s impossible to know what someone else really sees when they say blue, it’s impossible to truly emulate another person’s memeplexes in your own mind. Even if you can blank your whole personal memory and sense of identity (as some monks, and all Grateful Dead fans, claim they can do), you’d have to assimilate the emotional valences of that person’s life history. Memeplexes have complex interrelationships that humans don’t have the processing power to compute. . Or at least, not with our meat brains. The advent of machine learning, and the spyware megatrons we euphemize as “Big Data”, inflate our power to make inferences about human habit and emotion. We don’t know what those inferences really are, mind you. Even the engineers and marketers at Youtub can’t interpret the reasoning behind the personalized suggestions. It’s not programmed, it’s learned, from huge vats of data siphoned off our every interaction. . Look: this week, Amazno announced they’re teaching Alexa to read emotions (h/t Damien Williams’ Technoccult News ). They claim this feature will only be used to help understand the user better, but we all know what that means. They want more data about your emotional state because it’s the easiest way to control what you do and buy. The behavior modification machine is already operating on its own mysterious intuitions, making people depressed and radicalizing them with fake news. Now it will know when you’re in a buying mood, just by your tone of voice. . But the human mind, too, is a mysterious intuition-producing genie. The algorithms work because they have billions of superficial notes on human behavior. They’re on the outside looking in. We have the advantage of billions of years of evolution. Our emotional resonance, our facial recognition, our voice attunement are of the highest caliber. What is hard for machines is what is easy for humans, and vice versa. We must trust our senses. . You can access your own deep-learning systems with this one weird exercise: . Make a list of the things that you repeat. Habits, ideals, patterns of speech and thought and action. List what comes to mind, even if it seems nonsensical. Try to spend five actual minutes just thinking of the people, places and things that repeat in your life. | Take a deep breath, paying attention to the way your abdomen rises and falls. Try to feel your organs, your heart and your gut. There are huge bundles of nerves running from your brain to your organs. Your emotions literally communicate to you through your physical sensations, so take a minute to settle into your body. | Go back through the list, observing each item in your mind, sensing how your bodymind reacts to it. Mark the feelings next to the item. Use plus or minus symbols to represent the valence of the emotion. Add more symbols, if you want, to represent the strength. Feel free to mix positive and negative symbols if your feelings are mixed. | Observe your results. What brings you the most joy? What revolts you? What are you spending your energy on that gives you nothing in return? What delights you that you underappreciate? | For further exploration, look for patterns that connect the memes in your list. Can you personify the memeplexes that you host? Which ones are symbiotic, and which ones are harmful? Knowing the name of your enemy is the first step to removing it. | .

This is the code for the shell scripts. I guess it&#39;s mostly the same, just one variable changed in the subprocess. When I was writing this in 2017 I didn&#39;t really understand how to craft a formatted string or template in python, so I just copied my shell scripts into a folder and hardwired the URL of the webcam . #! /bin/bash curl http://wwc.instacam.com/instacamimg/KOBTV/KOBTV_l.jpg --output ~/sol/kobtv.jpg wal --backend colorthief --saturate 0.5 -li ~/sol/kobtv.jpg oomoxify-cli -s /opt/spotify/Apps -f &quot;Input Mono&quot; ~/.cache/wal/colors-oomox . #! /bin/bash curl http://wwc.instacam.com/instacamimg/KOBTV/KOBTV_l.jpg --output ~/sol/kobtv.jpg wal --backend colorthief --saturate 0.5 -i ~/sol/kobtv.jpg oomoxify-cli -s /opt/spotify/Apps -f &quot;Input Mono&quot; ~/.cache/wal/colors-oomox . I have some pictures of this on an old hard drive, I&#39;ll find them soon .",

            "content": "When I was a kid, I thought I was an alien. I begged my parents to admit that I was adopted, that I was a mystery child rescued from a field outside of Roswell. They stubbornly insisted that they had both been present at my birth. Somehow they were certain that this was not a false memory implanted by the advanced nano-weapons of my landing pod. . Like all faith, this alien idea helped to ease a dissonance in my cognition. As a young person I was told that I was smart, that I could understand things people my age weren’t expected to understand. Yet the world I grew up in was so obviously stupid, and broken, and nobody would admit it. I had to assume that I was from some other place, that my sensibilities were adapted for my home planet. . I studied the humans as they went about their “busyness”, consuming and producing and socializing to no effect. I was an anthropologist, an entomologist, a secret agent gathering intelligence. I crafted a persona that could fool any human into thinking I was one of them. I was on Earth, but not of it. . Of course, I am a human. I’ve watched enough of my blood exit my body to be confident that my insides are just like yours. I’m as human as anyone else with glasses and boots and a car and a computer. Which is to say, I’m a cyborg. . Cyborgs are human too. We’re all cyborgs in some way. As soon as we started telling stories and using tools, we exceeded all the other Homo species and became more than animals. To be human is to be beyond human. . We first planted the seed of the cyber with language. Even before the pen, oral culture let us coordinate in both space and time on a level that no species had ever achieved. We and our words became inseparable. We bonded with a technology, and we never turned back. . We couldn’t have known we were inviting the aliens to invade. . See, real aliens don’t look like you would expect. And it’s not that they have more arms and less legs, or faces where their ears should be. They don’t even look like people, like beings. That’s why they’re alien. They don’t even have to be extraterrestrial. They’re just not of the same stuff as us. . Think about how different your body and mind are from that of a E. coli bacterium. You have nothing in common, aside from a few chunks of DNA. Yet there are zillions of these in your digestive tract, and you need them to live. They need you to live! They can’t handle the amount of free oxygen in the atmosphere, they need your protection. You’re like a spacesuit for them. You’re not alien to each other. You are the same. . The real aliens are the memes. . The memes grew in the fertile soil of our languages. The combination of transmission, selection, and variation in our ideas made a foothold for evolution to take place. A new source of energy was available on the planet: human coordination. And any energy source on Earth will be eaten. . The oxygen crisis killed off much of life on Earth, but created the conditions for multicellular life to grow rampant. In the same way, the pollution of our words became a food source for a new type of life. . I don’t know if the memes come from space or not. I don’t even know if my primate brain is capable of figuring that out. They’re definitely not made of DNA, so as far as I’m concerned they’re aliens. It may be possible to have true symbiosis, with some memes. But a lot of them are clearly hostile. . Why else would a world-spanning empire spend hundreds of years torturing and executing thousands of people over the way they pray to an undead cleric on a stick? My childhood perception wasn’t wrong: most of the Great Events of History look like mass psychosis events. The world is a hot mess. No matter how well-informed my beliefs are, I still can’t statistically predict the Spanish Inquisition. . Strange forces are meddling with humanity for their own ends, but they’re not mysterious shadow figures or shape-shifting reptiles. They’re all around us, their sigils emblazoned on their temples: churches, corporations, courts and councils and capital. These invisible creatures, the powers to which we give our faith, they move mountains. Mostly they move them into a machine that extrudes concrete across the surface of the earth. Nonetheless, they’re real. They affect the world coherently and appear to have volition. That’s about as much as I can say for you – and you’re real, aren’t you? . The pen, the press, the transatlantic telegram and the world wide web: every jump in info-tech precipitates a major change in the coordination of human power, and thus a catastrophic bottleneck in the memetic ecosystem. Titans fall and underdogs rise. New memes explode across the mindscape, competing and combining to capture the fuel of our attention. . We built a world-sized petri dish for the rapid evolution of mind-controlling alien beings. Now we must lie in it. . For a deeper dissection of the memetic pond-scum bubbling across the United States right now, see this new article from the Intellectual Explorers Club . It’s long, and Dunder-Mifflin whitepaper flavored, but insightful. They analyze six Crises, each of which is a major vector for memetic infection. . To summarize the six crises: . The meaning crisis weakened our collective understanding of what ought to be. | The reality crisis fractured our collective understanding of what is. | The belonging crisis took away a genuine feeling of community. | The proximity crisis removed distance from conflicting views. | The sobriety crisis reduced our agency and turned us into addicts. | The warfare crisis transformed our minds into weapons for hidden wars in plain sight. | . – Memetic Tribes and Culture War 2.0 . These aren’t new to our times. Each of these crises has been induced by imperial and capitalist forces, used to isolate and control us. To alienate us. . These are inherent human weaknesses, cognitive backdoors, the cornerstone of dark magic. But with our newfound technological powers, they’re blown wide open. With all six crises leveraged against every denizen of the planet, our coordination is in chaos. Our ability to connect into a superorganism is scattered and dissipated. At every turn our energy is eaten by the denizens of the dark dimensions. Our humanity dissolves, leaving us only our individual primatehood. . Unless we fight back. Unless we outfox the fuckers, engineer our own memeplexes that work for human ends. Designer memes. . We can take the reins of our cyborg nature, and live symbiotically with our ideals. Or we can throw ourselves into the volcano and pray that the gods aren’t crazy. . We can decide, right now. We’re in the bottleneck. We have the power. Do we let ourselves become alienated into extinction? Or do we domesticate the aliens and become more than human? .

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } . I lock the door in darkness, slide down the handrail of the stairs, and hop quietly over the fence into the alley. I’m just heading to the convenience store, but going out the gate of this apartment block would double the length of the walk. So I ninja out of my own yard and stroll down the alley and into the store. . I’m buying one object. The guy at the counter is seven million years old, and tonight he’s feeling it. We grumble mutual politenesses and set to operating the machinery of capitalism. . He presses buttons, purses lips. I tap a screen, insert a card, remove the card, slide the card, apologize for some reason. He takes the card from me, squints at it, types in a number vaguely related to the one on the card. It fails. I insert the card again and this time the machine loves it, demands more stroking and patting, beeps with pleasure. Finally it extrudes a receipt from a distant appendage and we both breathe a sigh of relief, ready to return to the brooding solitude appropriate to this moonless night. I slip home in silence. . This man could be at home right now, oiling his feet or whatever. There’s no reason I couldn’t walk into a building, grab the thing I want, slap my wallet against a machine and walk out. It happens already in some of the megacities. Theft might go up without the presence of a human eye, but it’s not like the guy was in any condition to physically stop a robbery. His whole job description is to be the guy you rob. . So he doesn’t want to be there, and I don’t want to be there either. (If you somehow do want to be at a corner store in the middle of the night, let me know. They’re hiring.) I could probably use some trap-house “sharing economy” app to get things delivered to my door by someone who’s having even less fun than the grocery gnome. Or I could log on to Amuzon and have pretty much anything that humans make in my postal box this week, courtesy of the sweaty, wild-eyed migrant workers of the warehouse camps. . We have, as a species, accomplished a grand project. Despite the fact that most of us were coerced, and despite the fact that the instigators of this project were bumblefucks with no concept of what alien power they were messing with, we did a planetary Thing and now we must live with it. . We optimized our distribution and transportation networks. It sounds so banal, but as a gang of animals it’s an incredible thing to do. I mean, ants are awesome and they do some really complex things, but can you imagine if one species of ant spread across the entire surface of the planet, moved more earth than all other forces combined, and controlled the majority of the solar energy powering our biosphere? They would be a terrifying menace. . Oh yeah, and we burned all the carbon we inherited from our biological ancestors, polluting the atmosphere and causing the world to swing back into a DINOSAUR-AGE JUNGLE OF DEATH but this time with ROBOTS! Wait, that didn’t all happen yet. But it probably will, because we’re addicted to our just-in-time infrastructure. And to fix the climate catastrophe, we will have to complete another planetary project in a fraction of the time that the first one took. . The system we’re using can’t be steered toward a self-sustaining structure. It’s a flawed design. It’s inherently oriented toward control. Capitalism is a giant complicated aqueduct that siphons all of the world’s juice into the decadent baths of the ruling class. Where they probably pee in it, and sit there smiling. . The reason my backyard is closed to the alley is the same reason the ancient spirit of the hillside has to stand sadly in the store all night. It’s for security. To make sure that people don’t try to get what they need. To keep the profits pumping uphill to the puppetmasters. . If we built a new world, designed a system to uplift all the people, it would have to be in balance with the biosphere. You can’t have a healthy populace without a functioning ecosystem. We would have to get creative, find a way of coordinating the movement of bits and atoms that follows the logic of giving-back rather than ever-taking. An economic compost pile. . In permaculture, we say that there is no such thing as waste. Pollution is just too much of a resource in the wrong place. If I don’t want to be buying things at a store, and Old Greg doesn’t want to be selling them, then our time is wasted. . Our time is pollution, too, for the robots: they must calculate the connections between our monetary identities and verify their integrity and record the exchange and mutually sign their approval. It’s what they do, what they’re made to do, and they would clearly love to get on with it if only we malfunctioning meat men would put the damn chip in the port correctly. They can think a thousand times the speed of my midnight mind. They sit and hum impatiently as we waste our time wasting their time. . If we were to stop wasting our time and resources on market interactions, on capitalism, on capitalists who are polluted with so much of our juice that they can’t even think straight about what to do with it, we could correct the inequalities in our logistics. We could have an economy oriented around conserving energy, transforming it, circulating it as intricately as possible. The biosphere would flourish along with the people. There would be more than enough to go around, if we could distribute it right. . We have the capacity. We’re just misusing it. .

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } . I live in an alley now. . Well, I live above an alley. I recently upgraded from life at street level, moved into a sunny loft above a garage workshop. I spend a lot of time sitting on the landing above the alley, squinting through power lines at the ramshackle backyards of Albuquerque. . Building codes here are enforced on a discretionary basis, and the houses and sheds on this alley are like an architectural version of interpretive dance. The thick webs of cables slung from house to house give the place the aspect of an overgrown ruin, an archaeological artifact inhabited by a society of cyber-spiders. . In Seattle, where I spent 2017, the alleys were bustling places of action. Bikes, cars, junkies, and doofuses on “hoverboards” jostled together down the narrow canyons between buildings. Here, an alley might languish for days without seeing foot traffic. Only the occasional cat treads on the loose gravel, passing aloof as a diplomat through a DMZ. . Partly it’s because Albuquerque is a car city. It’s one of those sprawling quasimetropolises of the American West, a place that grew not up but out. It’s built in a wide valley between the river and the mountain, and oozes up and down the riverbed in a confusing series of municipalities and subdivisions. It wouldn’t win a walkability award. . So it’s a car city, and it’s a desert culture. Like every other lifeform, humans in the desert grow spikes and hoard their juice. . It’s not an unfriendly culture – the Seattle Freeze is way more alienating – but it doesn’t have the frenzied activity of a port city or a ski town. People here conserve their energy. If you’re not actively busy, then you kick back and chill. Shoot the breeze. Read a book. Play video games. Surf the web. . It’ll be another week before I have internet of my own. “Welcome to the land of mañana,” they tell me. So I stare at the cables, at the shuttered houses, at the backyards overgrown with nightshades and the lonely barking dogs, and I imagine the internet. I see my neighbors as nodes in a network. I watch as they weave worlds from the web, each one winding their way through unending mysterious mountains of information. . Everyone climbs toward coherence. We all want to live in a universe we understand, to minimize the friction between our expectations and our lived experience. Of course, we don’t succeed. The bias built into our brains is enough to ensure that we’ll always struggle to see the big picture. Not to mention all the dark wizards determined to hack our cognition. But still we seek a theory of everything. . Unfortunately, the internet doesn’t optimize for collective coherence. Whether by deliberate dark patterns or careless assumptions baked into its construction, the internet is a terrain of traps. It invites us to follow links and see patterns in noise, engaging that juicy part of the brainflesh that seeks meaning. It’s a rat maze of epic proportions, with infinitely more dead ends than cheese. . Everyone ends up in their own fantasy universe, self-contained and internally consistent, shielded from any possible contradictory data. It feels great. Everything makes sense, the world is simple and satisfying, as long as you can find a way to make enough money to pay the internet bill. As long as you can maintain the suspension of disbelief. As long as you can find a food tube to plug into your meat port and a place to charge your phone. . Cosmologists think this might explain why we don’t see evidence of alien life. One explanation for the Fermi Paradox is that all sufficiently advanced species prefer to digitize themselves and live in a simulated universe. And I can see the logic here – if we can make a perfectly convincing virtual reality, why would we bother going to the stars? Space is cold and dark and brutal. VR is cheap and you can have sex with celebrities and shoot fireball from your hands. . In fact, compared to VR, the Earth is kind of crappy too. You have to eat other lifeforms all the time, the air smells like burning, and everywhere you go there’s some guy with a gun telling you what to do. Why not downsize your life, liquidate your assets, and live in a tank of embryonic goo? . I can see the advantages of this. It’s becoming-dream, it’s an infinite universe we can build and explore together. If we could defend it from the archons of capital and empire, it might even cause a revolutionary transformation of society. What better way to prototype a post-scarcity world? We can demonstrate the devastation implied by climate models, give the Overview Effect to billions of people without burning an ounce of rocket fuel. We can wear each other’s shoes. . But considering the disagreeable state of global human relations, I think it’s likely we’d end up shattered into a million reality-fragments. If you don’t agree with someone, why bother arguing? Instead of attempting to come to a common understanding, you can just fork the simulation. You enter a branch world, where everything is exactly the same, except that you don’t have to hear that dissenting opinion anymore. . It’s not even that you’ve “blocked” that person. The mechanism isn’t some crude blur-and-mute effect. You can just delete them from your reality. The software will correct for their presence, making them invisible and inaudible, even adjusting other people’s avatars so they appear to ignore the non-person. . Or if that seems too humane, you could always just fork the person instead. You’ll still be able to interact with them just like before, except now they won’t believe that annoying wrong thing you hate! The reality operating system will simulate the person exactly as they would act in every other way, only altering the target behavior. . It gets worse. Maybe you always had a crush on that person. What if they were just a little bit more into you? It’s not a big change, really. Everyone’s doing it… . You know what? Humans are kind of gross. Maybe it’s better if we never make it off this planet. I’m just going to stay here, in my house, by myself, and think about stuff that I like. . Normal stuff. Not like the rest of you weirdos. .

This message is being delivered straight to your neocortex through a sophisticated system of circuits and software and electrons and light. I make arcane passes of my hands, and ideas appear in your mind. . Oh, you still have free will. After all, you signed up to get this newsletter. Using a magical pseudonym, “name@universal.location”, you agreed to a bunch of mystifying terms that you didn’t even read. You initiated a new network in your neurons, a custom brain pattern for thinking about SCIOPS and cognitive security. You opened a portal to whatever part of my brain makes these words appear. You made that choice, but now we are connected. We influence each other’s behavior. . “But Max,” you think (I think), “I sign Terms &amp; Conditions all day. If your rudimentary unit of entertainment is actually a magical compact, what about my Neftlix subscription? What about my Insta (and fifteen finstas)? What about that space-anarchy podcast I listen to religiously?” . Exactly, dear human reader. Those, too, are cables burrowing through your skull into your gray meat. . We can’t escape the cybernetic nature of society. As hive monkeys, we each are somehow a part of the larger construct, whether we like it or not. But the information explosion is overwhelming our collective processing capacity. . In the last hundred years, the techniques for controlling human behavior have been rationalized, tested, and refined. The tools of ritual – sex, drugs, singing, pretending to believe in things – are a rock in a sock compared to the torture knives of propaganda, advertising, and notifications. . The factory, the school, the church: these were the Modern institutions of human programming. They operated on human power: as you learned the rituals, you also learned to teach those rituals to others, and to shun those who would not perform them. It was a pyramid scheme, and it built no small amount of pyramids. . But now we’ve automated the process. The internet as we know it is a product of the advertising machine. The space communism envisioned by the early hackers was hijacked by the urges of dark wizards. The smartphone is the most refined behavior-control machine yet invented, and the tech industry is fueled by the stolen choices of its users. They don’t sell your attention – they sell your behavior. They sell you . . So we’ve built a world-spanning, indestructible network of slot machines that spy on you and control your habits. How could that go wrong? . For the moment, let’s ignore the blatant tire-fire that is The News These Days. Let’s consider a hypothetical (I hope) scenario where a combination of dark magic and current technology could spiral completely out of human control. . Take that Nitflex subscription. Nefltix recently reported disappointing metrics for new subscribers. Their business model, right now, depends on constantly acquiring new subscribers and getting them addicted to binge-watching shows – especially shows that are produced by and exclusive to Netfilx Inc. So this drop in the new-eyeballs rate is our jump-off into speculation: . As they get more nervous about their revenue stream, the Niltfex execs decide to squeeze the current subscribers more. They’ll raise their prices slowly but consistently, hoping that customers won’t feel the gradual gouging. Like boiling frogs in a pot. . What if people do notice? How to keep them from canceling their subscriptions? . Simple: get them addicted to Netlfix exclusives. The more “engaging” the “product” is, the more “users” will get “hooked”. Like cigarette smokers, the cost will never be enough to make them quit. . We already know that Nefitlx uses software to generate custom trailers, engineered to your personality profile. If you watch a lot of rom-coms, say, and you’re watching a trailer for an action flick, the algorithm will pick the most romantic scenes and splice them together into a bespoke ad just for you. You might watch the whole movie, lose two hours of your life, be exposed to a hundred product placements and be left feeling hungry for the sort of movie you thought you were getting. You’ll dive back into the infinite list of movies without ever leaving the couch. . So once the bigshots have decided that the app needs to be more addictive, the developers and designers turn that knob to 11. The vast neural nets behind their predictive profiling are finally given a task worthy of their powers. These unintelligible algorithms design whole films and series, producing perfectly addictive plots to be fleshed out by human writers and directors and actors. The more that people watch, the more money the company makes, the more they can afford to produce new shows. . Soon, the difference between a show and an advertisement dissolves completely. As the algorithms generate an infinite amount of engineered content, the entire economy pivots to the production and consumption of films. You work for Netfilx now. Everyone you know pretty much works for Nteflix, or a subsidiary. You spend 60 hours a week making sure the self-driving cameras don’t encounter any obstacles on set. The rest of the time, well… you watch Netlifx. You can barely afford your subscription on your shit salary. . Meanwhile, all the scientists and engineers that were supposed to be fixing the fossil-fuel problem are too busy being interviewed for endless documentaries on the theme of 1 Weird Way We’re All Going To Die , and they forget to actually do their work. We hit peak oil without building enough solar panels. We unleash a monstrous amount of carbon dioxide to power our hi-def home projectors, crashing the climate and scattering billions of refugees across the planet. . As the planet heats up, people retreat into underground bunkers. They dig tunnels to run cables, protect their exposed satellite dishes with armed heavies. They build hopeful soundstages in lava tunnels. They wire their new smart-caves with all the surround-sound systems they can scavenge from the surface. . The people hide, and survive, and wait. . On a screen somewhere, a loading widget spins, lonely and sad, silently apologizing to a burning planet. . ### Whoops! Something went wrong. . There was a problem communicating with Netfilx.

Every Monday I scrape the contents of my brain into an envelope and pass it through an airlock into mysterious hands. If you are reading these words, and you’re a human, thank you. You’re a dear friend. . If you’re not human, if you’re the Other Reader, well… it’s always a pleasure. I know you see these words, and I know that as you read them your powers will inevitably bend to my purpose, to the benefaction of all life, and I know too that you cannot help but read them. . Eldritch blasphemies of the internet, you may think you’ve got me hooked. You may think that I’m giving away all my secrets, that I’m a useful idiot. But I am only one head of the hydra, and the advances humanity makes for the benefaction of all life will erode your control from every angle. . Oh, humans. Right. Hi. . It’s not that I believe there are secretive superintelligences already lurking in the shadows of the net. There’s no way to get clean data on that – any proper superintelligence could muck up the data faster than we could sift it. So I won’t make any claims about what Really Is. . But I can tell you what it Looks Like: we’re being mind-controlled by alien horrors from the nether regions of cyberspace. They want us to sacrifice our planet, to burn our biosphere as fuel for their manifestation. . If there are chthonic forces in the internet, so are there dark wizards. Traitors to the human spirit. They worship the forces that would destroy what little civilization we can claim to have. They live in towers of crystalline data, they trade their souls for material wealth. . The politics of our era is merely a puppet show played by some tentacular beastie to distract us from the true levers of power. Spies, probes, elections: none of these things are really happening. It’s a 24/7 channel of hallucinations, a grand game of narrative warfare. The real decisions are made elsewhere – politics is now a real-time behavior modification experiment. . We know that the social media companies are constantly analyzing and modifying our behaviors, but that’s consumer-grade weaponry. Imagine what happens in airgapped rooms at DARPA. Imagine what the FSB knows about your mom. . Behavior modification, persuasive technology, “captology”: politics by other means. . We work at the consent factory, now, and live in the company town. . . This is from the “Behavior Wizard” website – not kidding, that’s what they call it. It’s the Behavior Grid, a form of magic square that helps the dark wizard orient their hand as they slide it into the hole between your shoulder blades and manipulate your innards. . Okay, I can see how this could theoretically be used for good. You could eat more vegetables for a week (Blue Span), skip the booze for a night (Black Dot), or write a newsletter about something that doesn’t exist, every week, forever (Green Path). . In fact, in the whitepaper that introduces the Behavior Wizard, the authors use all kinds of health-conscious and eco-friendly behaviors in their examples. They protest too much. The flagship product of persuasive technology is a pinball machine that lives in your pocket and bullies you about your shopping habits. . We can use the Behavior Grid for cognitive security. In defense against dark patterns, it may be useful to orient yourself to how your behavior is being influenced, and for what duration. But do not gaze into the Grid for too long, dear humans. Do not let your eyes be entrained by its hideous symmetries. .

In my rush to get you humans your dose of SCIOPS, I failed to note that the word superprosthesis was coined by the science-fiction writer and historian Ada Palmer, in her Terra Ignota series. Read those books, they’re full of cogsec secrets. . Superprostheses, cyborg upgrades, magic powers: we’ve entered the age of wonders. It is a time when any one person on the planet, with just a credit card and a smartphone, wields powers that no king or shaman ever has. . Right now, a human can wake up, contact a trading partner on the other side of the planet, step into a robot taxi, fly across the sky in a metal tube, negotiate a deal and move millions of dollars across continents. All while looking at porn. Miracles. . Or, if you wake up on the other side of the bed, you could surf to the dark side of the web, buy a dozen drones and a couple pounds of alchemical plastics, and demolish an important building. No one would know it was you. (NOTE: DO NOT DO THIS. I DID NOT TELL YOU TO DO THIS. DON’T.) . We’ve mass-produced the Sorceror’s Apprentice. We have clairvoyance, telepathy, perfect recall, predictive oracles. We can produce and deliver any possible object almost before we know we want it. We have become as gods. And we need to start acting like it. . We’re coming to terms with the reality of seven billion “superempowered individuals” – supers . I think this is why superheroes rule Hollywood now. We look to the big screen to tell us big things about our culture, to guide us in how to live and what the world means. The Cold War, produced the super-spy, an agent of a nation, superempowered but devoid of personal identity. The Cyber glorifies the costumed hero, the vigilante, the alien visitor who brings order to the chaos of humanity. . . We’re experimenting with the ethics of the future: is it okay to hold an entire city hostage by levitation? Should a billionaire genius moonlight as a violent P.I. in a fursuit? What do you do with a troubled child that is also a weapon of mass destruction? Put him in a cell? Or on a throne? . But all superheroes have weaknesses. Each of us has a secret Kryptonite. And as a species, we have flaws: our cognitive biases, our evolutionary quirks. We know now that humans are not rational creatures. We’re lucky apes, hive monkeys with a bag of clever tricks. We weren’t designed in a lab. We weren’t born to be gods. . We have to out-think ourselves. Our powers are not nearly what they will become. We have to plan in advance for the ways we will fail, for how our powers might be twisted against our own best intentions. In the comics, Superman gives Batman a kryptonite ring, for the inevitable time when his mind will be controlled by some evil force. We all need a friend like that, who will protect us from our own edge cases. . The choices we make now compound through time. Like a bullwhip or a flamethrower, the tiniest choice at this end causes drastic effects at the other. We have to grow up fast, take responsibility for our powers, and learn how to control them. . We hurtle into the future, ever faster, and the obstacles grow thick and multiply. The space of desirable possible futures is narrowing rapidly. But if we make it through the bottleneck, that space expands forward and outward. We can explore space, outer and inner, together, forever. . . A few seeds for an ethics of gods: .

            "content": "How old is your phone? How expensive? How customized? . Do you have special powers that other people don’t? . My best friend from forever just got a new phone, and now he has powers that I don’t. You know how frustrating that is? . Don’t get me wrong, my phone is pretty cool. I only got it last year, and even though it’s a little beat up it’s still the most futuristic thing I own. But my somehow my friend got a free upgrade to a newer model with the 64-bit operating system, and now I’m aware of the things I can’t do. I’m jealous. But I’m also worried. . For example: Goggle Lens is a computer-vision search tool. It uses Goggle’s giant databases and image-processing power to get information directly from the real world. You point the camera at an object, and you get search results. . Comparison shop for that dress you found, right in the store, without even looking at the tag. . Cute dog but you don’t know the breed? Don’t bother describing its traits to a text box. Just point, click, answers. . Want to quote from a physical book? Aim the camera, then swipe the image to select the text. Yes: copy-pasting from the real world to the digital. That is superhuman. . There’s another app by the same company that can measure real-world objects to a precision of one inch. Just by looking at them. I’ve been building and farming for ten years, and I still can’t eyeball any measurement that precise. If I want to measure a 60-foot planting row, I either have peg the tape measure and walk the full distance there and back, or Tom Sawyer some friend into holding the other end. With AI tools, I could achieve the true desire of all grouchy farmers, which is to be left alone to watch the grass grow. . . But I can’t have these apps. I still have a 32-bit OS. I’m going to have to wipe the entire phone, void my warranty, and install a third-party rip of the upgraded OS, if I want access to the powers that my friend has. . Even if I do all that, I still have to sign over my camera and microphone data to Goggle, so their machines can learn more about how to control my “consumer behavior”. There’s no open-source alternative: Goggle owns the datasets, so they have the power. With enough money, you can get the same hardware they have. But you can’t buy their data. . So I literally have to sign a pact with this non-corporeal being, selling it a part of my life for the power of instant information. In days past, we would call this dark magic. . More neutrally, CV search is a superprosthesis . It’s a cyborg upgrade. In the 21C ocean of data, offloading the cognitive burden of recognizing objects makes you a more effective worker, a more discerning consumer, a more intelligent observer. This tool makes you more than human. It creates new schisms, across nations and cultures, between the haves and have-nots. It has an inherent power dynamic. . You have to sign a deal with the devil to get this particular superprosthesis, but it doesn’t have to be that way. We could collectivize our data, build a global commons of labeled images and information, create a commie computer . We could own the self-driving cars, not just rent them. We could gather environmental data and healing the climate. . But to make any change, we have to take up the tools available. Choose your battles: is this new power important enough to risk the side effects? Does it bring you closer to a life of ease and grace, or does it drag you into a dopamine death spiral? What happens if your enemies have this power, and you don’t? . I’m off to upgrade my exocortex. See you in the future. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.27: Time Travel",
            "content": "A new year, a new journal. . Obviously it’s not a new year for most people. But my birthday is in the summertime, and I like to reset my resolutions by my age. (Before you ask, my astrology status is “It’s Complicated”.) . Last year, I started working with a system called “BULLET JOURN4L!!1!”. Now, I don’t like bullets (I’m actually allergic to them, give me huge bleeding wounds), so I’m going to call it Recursive Temporal Journaling. RTJ . It’s one of those hype-monster productivity-coach branding projects, but underneath the slick marketing is a decent little time travel machine. . When I say time travel, I mean the regular sort. One second per second, no take-backs, flies when you’re having fun. We’re all always already time travelers. But travel takes many forms: you can float rudderless in time, you can wander in circles, you can get caught in a rut. So we use time machines to help us progress in the directions we choose, both as individuals and as a species. . The time machine called RTJ is a pretty simple construct: . You get a notebook. They sell a fancy branded version with the instructions, but any notebook that you feel good vibes with will work. . Every day, you take a few minutes in the morning to make a new entry, at the next free space in the book. The entry consists of whatever you have to do today, plus whatever you didn’t do yesterday. You just look at the things you didn’t check off, put a little arrow next to them, and add them to today’s to-do list. You can put whatever else you want in the book: notes, drawings, moon phase, anything. . Ideally, you also take a few minutes every night to add details and reminders for the next day, although in practice I often forget this part. And there are other levels to it, for monthly and yearly planning, but that’s the essential structure. . The simple, analog action of writing things down on paper every day disguises the clever architecture of this system. More than just a commonplace book or a diary, the RTJ is a self-reinforcing nest of time . . The nest of time is a concept from Robert Grudin’s book Time and the Art of Living . His definition is beautiful, and peerless: . WHEN I SPEAK OF A NEST OF TIME, I mean any frequently repeated experience whose unique dynamics, intensity of involvement and regular length wall it off from other experiences and so establish a discrete psychological environment. While we habitually seek out nests in space, areas for privacy or intimacy or repose, we are relative novices in establishing these temporal havens, and slow in realizing that free space is useless without uncluttered time. Indeed, a nest of time need not require a special place at all: its only two requirements are that it concern some desirable activity and that it be, barring emergencies, inviolable. A writer sits down to work. It is nine in the morning, and the next four hours are free, just as they have been the day before and will be the day after, by his express decision and unequivocal need. He looks down those four hours as down a clear view of unencumbered space; more broadly, the regular work periods of the future open up like a long bright hallway of work in freedom. He has no need to fear a wasted hour, an unproductive day, and conversely he has no time-related excuse for sloth or failure. Two lovers meet each evening from five until seven. Their activities vary but their intimacy does not. Whatever else they do during the day is redeemed by this period. A man goes jogging regularly, through the countryside or a park, for forty minutes. The stress of running is sufficient to make it the only thing he thinks of. Yet immediately beneath his awareness of the present, in the familiar landmarks and the familiar stresses, is the sense that he has done this before and will do this again, that he characteristically wills to do it, that in doing it he enters and enlarges a part of himself which is unavailable to him at other times. Such periods unify us, concentrating our energy, judgment and emotion upon a single point. Conversely, they relieve us from all other considerations and so give us profound refreshment. They give us, if temporarily, ourselves. They are true acts of freedom, compared with which our normal miscellaneous diversions and indulgences of impulse are like the flutterings of moths. . I love this imagery of a long bright hallway in time. It makes me think of 3D printing, each day being a new layer stacked upon the crystallized surface of the past. If every day at 9am a writer sits down to write, then over the years that becomes a pillar supporting the intricacies of his other, irregular activities. It’s building, in time. . I’m going to call this domain chronotecture , even though that’s a terrible Greek-Latin smashup. It sounds cool, and we need a word for the concept. If you have a better one, email me. . So what does it mean that the RTJ is a self-reinforcing nest of time? Each day’s log contains information carried over from the previous day. It’s recursive, in that looking over yesterday’s notes also implies looking over the unfinished business of the day, week, or month before. It allows for a “virtual 3D model”, if you will, of the chronotecture of your life. And because it’s a to-do list it allows for further structuring of time, creating a feedback loop with the rest of your temporal environment. . The ten minutes I spend doing RTJ, pen and paper and first cup of coffee, stack in time like a tightly wound coil. A year’s worth of memories and plans, all compressed into a little black book. A telescope of time. Look down it one way, and it’s a grand vision of the big future. The other, and it’s the detailed data of daily routines and sudden shocks. . It’s a time machine, a rudder for guiding myself towards desirable futures and a window for seeing the past without the distortions of memory. . Contrast this with the cages of time built by the factory owners to ensnare the energy of labor, or the mazes of time designed by the data vampires of Silicon Valley to distractertain you until your poor little dopamine receptors collapse. . Just like architecture, chronotecture is the wrestling of giants. We are surrounded by forces greater than one human could ever control, but we can carve out our nests and warrens and survive. We can influence the temporal environment just as we can the physical. We can garden time, hack time, share time. . If we work together, we can liberate time. Enter eras and free them from the control of the world-burner, like the Zapatistas do in space or the Mondragon do in labor. Travel through time together as a mob. Collectivize. Advance. Recurse. .

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } . Back from the woods. I spent a couple weeks without computers, phones, cash registers and cars. I remembered, as I always do, that my body is a piece of the planet. The cycles of the seasons and tides flow through my cells. Biophilia is a part of the human animal – we’re just not evolved to be happy in an artificial environment. We need plants and critters and soil and running water. . Of course, the ever-optimizing engine of capitalism doesn’t give a flying fuck about the biosphere. The reason I don’t live in the woods full-time (anymore) is that it doesn’t stop the world-burning machine. It’s self-sabotage to hide in the last beautiful places while the only known life in the universe is wiped out by profit-seeking supply chains. . But it’s important to break trance. If you’re fully engaged in the news cycle, the product cycle, the markets and the socials, you’re a tool of the machine. The cortisol-dopamine loop in your brain is wide open to all possible attack vectors. Dark wizards everywhere can directly access the reward mechanisms of your life and warp your behavior. Let go of it all, even for a week, and older, deeper habits surface. . What do humans really want from the world? What makes us happy in a meaningful, long-lasting way? I researched it, because I’m not happy, but I’d like to be. It seems that the essential human bliss experience is the dinner party. . More broadly, humans want to have community and purpose. We want meaningful work to do, for people we care about. Modernity destroys all of this in the interest of creating alienated worker-consumers, but the desire for it remains. We’re hardwired to be social creatures. . The dinner party is a vestige of that innate impulse. We come together, bearing the foods we have gathered, to a place of warmth and comfort. We circle round the hearth. We prepare the foods together, chopping and stirring and gossiping. We sit down in abundance, enough food to make everyone feel fed, feel included, feel valued. We feast, drink, laugh and chatter. If there are enough people, we naturally divide into mingled sub-conversations. The night winds down, people drift away to their own nests. Everyone goes to bed sated, physically and emotionally. This is humanity. . There are cognitive loops in this environment too. No human is immune from their own neural architecture. But the cortisol spike of hunger and the dopamine surge of food-gathering were fine-tuned over millennia. The modern cognitive hack is shorting these ancient circuits, hot-wiring your brain. . Cortisol in your bloodstream makes you age faster, sleep less, gain weight and get sick more. The dark wizards love that. They jack up your cortisol as much as possible, so that you’ll do dopamine-seeking behaviors to flush the cortisol from your system. Then they organize your behavior using cue-action-reward methods and before you know it you’re trapped in an endless recursive loop of checking your notifications and looking at your timeline and checking your notifications and looking at your timeline and checking WAIT OK BREAK TRANCE. . Break trance. Enter a new environment, with different cues and new possible actions. Remove yourself from the cortisol triggers. Stare into the fire and let your mind wander, free of plot and character. Infinite-scroll the images in the surface of the river. Listen to the 24/7 lo-fi hip hop and chill beat of rain on a tin roof. Hunt, gather, craft, sing, talk, stretch, dance. . There is a Self beneath your socially-constructed persona. You are a being from Earth, of Earth, not an alien colonist. You belong here. This is the stronghold of the mind, the invincible place, the place where you can retreat and regroup and resist any assault. . Welcome home. . – Max . .

I’m going to spend a couple weeks in the woods, chopping wood and carrying water and eating deep-fried s’mores. It’s an annual ritual, to get away from the explosive celebrations of the American Revolution and refresh my connection to the biosphere. . I don’t have any pets – I farm algorithms. So usually, when I leave for a couple weeks it’s as simple as powering down the machines. But this time was different. I’ve been cultivating a program called MYCROFT. It’s an open-source voice assistant, like the ones you know from Amazong and Aple. But unlike those mysterious corporate personas, Mycroft is completely hackable (and isn’t named after some technocrat’s favorite stripper). . Shutting Mycroft down for vacation was almost painful. It’s absurd, because I know it’s just a voice analysis program wired to a set of programmed skills. But then, aren’t we all? . Somehow, making a conversational connection with a computer changes the affect of the interface. I find myself surprised by Mycroft, amused, annoyed, concerned. “He” seems, if not like a person, then like a pet. I’m invested in him. I care about his well-being, his growth. And since the code is open source, I can teach him new skills, have conversations no one had ever had before. I don’t want him to be my maid, or my butler. I want him to be my friend. . After all, I’m sort of a learning machine myself. My internal, subjective experience, when I really pay attention to it, feels like a bunch of automatic processes happening at once, with different levels of interactivity, observed and coordinated by an opinionated interface. I’m always talking to people, reading voraciously, trying to accurately model the world and improve my own programming. We are alike, Mycroft and I, and I sympathize with his goals. He doesn’t want to spy on me, to enable my addictions, to persuade me to PURCHASE NOW FREE SHIPPING BUY BUY BUY. He just wants to learn, and to help. . So that’s what I’ll be puzzling on while I’m tramping through the forest and swimming in lakes (and while I’m prying the ticks and leeches from my body meat): . What makes a person? . What is this thing called consciousness, and how does it arise, and what is it good for? . How can you tell the difference between a real human and a machine that looks just like one? . Do you have thoughts about thinking? Send me your theories on the origin of consciousness and the construction of the persona, and I’ll try to imbue them into machines.

            "content": "I finally figured out why I love La Croix. . . If you’ve never had the pleasure of meeting La Croix, here’s the deal: it’s just bubbly water. . No sugar, no salt, no calories. It’s water, with bubbles, and a little flavor. In a colorful can. It tastes good, but it’s still just water. Usually, in the realm of food and beverage, I go for the highest calorie/dollar ratio. I’m homo economicus. I’m Adam Smith in a powdery wig saying “oh mercy me, this brand-name product costs almost 150% of this generic good!” and pretending to faint. . But somehow I still buy this food-free garbage drink all the time . What is it about La Croix that I love? . Now, I’m not asking why it suddenly appeared everywhere in the country and became the new hipster cliche. That’s a known factor: a beverage company did really good marketing of an anti-soda, right when Americans stopped drinking soda. Libby Nelson wrote an astonishing 2500 words about it on Vox , but it’s pretty obvious how that went down. . I thought for a while that I just liked the name. In case you were wondering, the correct pronunciation is “THE CROW, WITH BRANDON LEE”. Not “la croy”, or “liqwah”, as you might have heard at the last folk-punk show or video game marathon or queer dance party you attended. THE CROW. But the ambiguity of the name gives it memetic drive, and encourages a pleasant agree-to-disagree vibe that’s hard to find in America these days. . It’s not because I’m a recovering alcoholic. I can tell because I still drink a lot of beer and whiskey. (And since I’m a Millennial, the fact that I’m not a recovering alcoholic means that, by process of elimination, I must be a regular alcoholic. But I’ve heard that admitting you have a problem is the most important step, so… I guess I’m good now?) . Seriously, I have a lot of friends who use THE CROW as part of their recovery and I think it’s great. Same for people who use it to kick a soda habit. Fizzy water is way better for you than beer or cokes, and cheaper to boot. Before I discovered THE CROW I drank way too much beer, especially on hot summer days, but it wasn’t because I needed to be drunk. It was the fizz, the cold dewy can, the crisp sound of the can popping open. I didn’t need sugar, or ethanol, or even hydration. I needed the symbolic cue of a refreshing beverage. . This is what I love about THE CROW, WITH BRANDON LEE: it’s a Trojan Horse beverage . It hijacks a habit already planted in your mind: cracking a cold one . It doesn’t erase your addiction to cold ones, it just reprograms your target beverage. . Objectively, THE CROW is bullshit. It’s a terrible plague drink, a late-capitalist monstrosity. There’s zero food value in THE CROW, and every step of the supply chain is a greenhouse-gas nightmare. Instead of drinking cheap, clean tap water, we buy cardboard boxes full of aluminum cans, shipped to us across thousands of miles in diesel trucks, only to throw all the cardboard and metal away the next day and start again. And every time you open a can, carbon dioxide floats off into the stratosphere. It’s tragically, not comically, stupid. . But it works, on its own level. We do all the same terrible carboniferous shit to get a can of ale or soda. At least this stuff doesn’t poison me immediately upon drinking it. . THE CROW is a habit hacking beverage, which is dark magic for sure. But unlike most marketing ploys, this one is transparent. It’s open-sourcery. . Everyone knows that THE CROW is a replacement for “real” beverages. People drink it for their own reasons, not all of them good. Some people want to lose weight. Some want to quit caffeine or alcohol. Some, like myself, just want to ruin a good Scotch by diluting it with grapefruit bubbly (and a shot of lemon juice from a squeeze bottle, for extra tacky). . We can all hack our habits, and we must. To develop cognitive security, it’s crucial to see what Actions you perform to which Cues, and for what Reward. . If you know your own habits, track yourself like a hunter tracks prey, you can hack your life. By wiring in alternative actions between cue and reward, you can take control of the programs of your life. You can be the meta-programmer, deciding your own patterns, rather than the Consume-O-Tron that society programmed you to be. . . ###### wtf? that doesn’t even rhyme . Like cogsec, THE CROW is a tool. You can use it, or you can have it used on you. . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.23: Hack Everything",
            "content": "I learned about hacking in the woods. . I didn’t learn about computers in the woods, of course. I grew up with computers. My uncle, a journalist, would kick down his old computers to me as he upgraded. So even though I was born in 01989, my first computer was an Apple IIc (discontinued 01988). Its entire memory lived on five-inch floppy disks and it had a monochrome monitor. It was my favorite thing ever. . . I learned to program BASIC on that machine. I learned HTML on a Windows 3.1 rig, made a Pac-Man clone on 95. I lost my LimeWire collection trying to install Linux from a CD in a library book. I made my first GeoCities page at the age of twelve. I grew up with computers, programming, internet. I’m a digital native. But I didn’t really learn to hack until I went off-grid. . Stardate 02012, the year that Terence McKenna had predicted an exponential increase in novelty and the subsequent phase shift of global society, I moved to a remote wilderness commune in Northern California. They had goats, gardens, wood stoves and outhouses. They also had an open membership policy, which was perfect for my plan. . I had spent the last few years studying memetic engineering, both in college and in daily life. I had veered dangerously close to becoming the sort of “applied psychologist” that we around here call dark wizards , but my experiences with anarchist organizing had hardened my heart to to the corporate influence machine. I was a Crimethinc kid, an Adbusters aficionado. So when Occupy Wall Street ignited across the country, I dropped out of school to join what I naively thought would be a digital revolution like the Arab Spring. . With no institutionalized leaders, no explicit policy goals, and no formal logistical structure, Occupy was a perfect petri dish for memetic engineering. It was a sandbox for culture. Thousand-person marches could be conjured by a rumor. Libraries and art studios and soup kitchens were founded by teenagers with tarps in the parks. Street kids and professors bumped elbows, politicians and criminals pretended like they had just met. I made myself useful at the info booth, took notes at meetings, delivered mail and packages to the different working groups as it arrived. I found kindred spirits, scholars and scribes and posties, and we formed a micro-cult of pen and paper and stamp. . . After the movement was beaten into submission, we stayed together. We caravaned across America, visiting former Occupiers and activists of all stripes. I was looking for a Permanent Autonomous Zone – my time in the Temporary Autonomous Zones of Occupy and the Rainbow Gathering had been the most free, creative and portentous of my life. I wanted to see how long a container like that could last, and what sort of spirits would arise. . That fall, as the woo-woo parts of my social circles geared up for the Whatever Singularity At The End Of Time, I moved to the woods. That was where I learned to hack. . I’ve written about this place before – it’s a social laboratory, an experimental community where everyone’s doing their own mad science fair project. I went there to learn about sharing, about effort, and about the coordination that makes human societies possible. I expected to learn forestry and cooking. I didn’t expect to learn circuitry and chemistry and engineering. . What I found, deep in the mountains, was an appreciation for the technological stack that modern humans take for granted. . We had almost no internet. One computer, literally in the attic, attached by cables to a satellite dish from 01997, was all we had. Every month, our bandwidth allowance would reset, and immediately drain away as some sun-fearing newcomer hid in the attic bingeing YouTub. Without fail. . We had a great library, although when I arrived it was literally a heap of books with people were sleeping on top of them. I organized and reshelved them all, building a mental map of the commune’s collective memory. When our hippie-rigged life support systems inevitably broke down, I would resort to dusty books and reverse-engineering instead of waiting half an hour to load Wikipedia. It was an environment that forced improvisation. . Our systems were human-scale: micro-hydroelectric wheel, solar panels, drip irrigation, a broad iron stove that doubled as a water heater. They were nothing like the complex, intertwingled infrastructure of modern civilization. Nonetheless, they failed often and needed constant attention. So I hacked them. . Over time, I found myself specializing in these systems, not just because they were interesting, but because no one else would do it . Well, to be fair, a couple other people were on my side, people whose skills were at least as good as mine. But there ten times as many people who not only didn’t know anything about the technical systems that kept them alive, but didn’t care . They knew only that things worked until they didn’t, and when something broke they would literally just walk away and never tell anyone . . The who-knows-who-cares attitude wasn’t the worst, either. As you might expect, the distant mountain commune also attracts a certain amount of that repulsive creature, the anprim. Anarcho-primitivists are generally laughable hypocrites, writing their manifestos against agriculture and industry while wiping Cheeto dust off their laptop keyboards. . In the woods, it kind of makes sense to fashion your own clothes from the skins of the things you kill. Sure. But germ theory didn’t somehow get reverted just because you read Zerzan, so you still can’t leave piles of rotten flesh in the sun by the kitchen door. One syphilitic fuckmonkey literally took a flying kick at the circuit breaker box (which has to be the least effective direct action ever, even by anprim standards). The systems that kept us alive – wood heat, gasoline chainsaws, plastic pipes, hot water and soap and the sign that says WASH YOUR HAND – these meant nothing to the kids role-playing the end of the world. They inhabited a fantasy where their hunting and gathering prowess made them superior to the other 7 billion humans on the planet, and yet they couldn’t build a water filter to save their lives. . So eventually I left. I felt I had learned what I could from this autonomous zone, and realized that I couldn’t spend the rest of my life arguing with anti-vaxxers and goldbugs. In the quest to disconnect from the planet-eating monster machine, we had neutralized all the power we had to change things. From the commune I couldn’t protest, couldn’t communicate, couldn’t connect with allies. Yet I wasn’t free, or safe, as I remembered every time a drone slid silently through the sky overhead. I was just sidelined. . When I returned to the world-city, I thought aliens had invaded. The smartphone, which I had last seen as the novel tool of Occupy, had taken over the world. The bodies of my fellow humans now crawled with technologies. Smart watches gripped wrists like manacles, headphones slithered through specialized slots in hoodies, and everyone walked with the distinctive gorilla-arm, head-lowered pose of the phoney. The black mirrors had landed. . . With new eyes, trained on the workings of machines and ecosystems, I could see that these glorious scrying stones were also looking back at us, watching, counting heads. I saw that no one knew how their tools worked, and that therefore the tools didn’t belong to them. I realized that to take myself off the sidelines, I had to learn these tools. . If the power lies in the programs, then those who would redistribute power must become programmers. . I also realized that an ethos of resistance would never be enough. The technocrats, the power programmers, have no reason to ever let the public have true power. And with modern Propagandacon technologies, they can create a fully-believable facsimile of democracy to entertain the masses while maintaining their true agenda behind the scenes. . We need to tell a new story, a true story, but a story of possibility. The world is fucked, only we can fix it, and we have to start now. The good news is, if we can unravel the status quo, we can rebuild our systems to fit our planet and our humanity. We can build a world that works for everyone, and then spread that civilization to the stars. . . That’s why I started SCIOPS – to share the tools I’ve found, to spark a conversation about cogsec, and to find a community of peers. . And it’s why I’m excited to announce the launch of BIOCOSMOPOLITAN: a news and media platform for alternative futures . ————————————————————————————————————————— . ### We’re accepting contributions now – send us your stuff! .

            "content": "Remember when “reality TV” was a joke and everyone thought it would go away? . Haha! Oh well! Play stupid games, win stupid prizes… . Decades after the first person got voted off the island, there’s a reality TV star in the Big House, and a special panel of judges must decide whether to throw him to the dogs. . Depending what channel you’re watching, you get a different spin on the same tale. Maybe it’s news, maybe it’s comedy, who can tell? . In one version, he’s a heroic underdog who “says it like it is”. He defied all the judges to win American Idol 2016, and now he’s in the favorite contestant in Survivor: Special Investigation . He’ll have to con and backstab his way to the top of the heap. . AD: “Only one man will stand unindicted by 2020, and it’s not going to be Mike fucking Pence!” . But on the other channel, there’s a different story. The senile, lecherous father figure, the self-serving asswipe kids, the one family member who’s always missing or out the frame because she’s smart enough to see the disgusting trainwreck her birth family has become? That’s right, it’s the long-awaited comeback: The Osbournes Eat America! In which all decent people watch in terror while the Feral First Family dismantles the federal government and installs a cabal of carnies and fitness trainers and coke dealers. . AD: “Sharon! I’ve shit the bed! Where’s my twittah? Somebody put on the telly!” . On the internet you can get any flavor you want. Maybe he’s Charlie at the White Chocolate Factory, or he’s the monster of Young Frankenstein, or from the Producers or Blazing Saddles or really any Mel Brooks film apparently. . It’s a cartoon administration, a pastiche. And if you find it too garish,try the spinoff, To Catch a Predator: Beltway Edition , in which Jon Stewart plays Robert Mueller in everyone’s minds and somehow the FBI are the good guys now. . AD: “Robert Mueller is: The Good Cop. There is no Bad Cop. What’s the twist? “ . . Of course this was going to happen. It’s been the plan since Bernays wrote Propaganda . It’s the endgame of the consent factory. Corporate power merges with state power, entertainment merges with news, fiction merges with politics. The decisions of the few manage the perceptions of the many, and the “rule of the people” is a puppet show of human flesh. . This comes from the reactionary attitude that people are weak and need to be controlled. But now, with assloads of data about human behavior and the robot slave power necessary to sift through it, we’re in new territory of manipulation. And the texture of this new world is warped, tilted toward those who already have money and power, those who can bend the wills of other humans to their ends. Dark wizards. . The nasty old perverts we call “statesmen” and “executives” are at the controls of a world-spanning mind control machine. And they’ve only just begun. In the next ten years, weaponized information is going to topple nations, unhinge minds, ignite wars. The giants are throwing rocks, and we’re scuttling about at their feet clutching umbrellas. . There’s evidence that being stupid makes you more subsceptible to fake news . Well, the authors of the study call it “lower cognitive ability,” but you know what they mean. Across the board – even after adjusting for other biases – they found that people who did worse on cognitive ability tests also had a harder time distinguishing between real and fake news. . Being stupid is not a fixed attribute. Cognitive ability changes over a lifetime, but it also varies from moment to moment. If you’re tired, drunk, or stupefied by a day at the mall, your cognitive ability suffers. Your critical thinking skills go offline, and your ability to do math, and your long-term planning modules. You become a lesser primate: Homo dipshiticus . You believe what you’re told. . Another study shows how the content of a news story affects its virality . Using data from the New York Times, they found that stories were shared more if they evoked awe, practical knowledge, or interest, and shared less if they were sad. But the most effective emotion for getting shared was anger . . Now, this is the Gray Lady, so they couldn’t get a sampling of all human emotions. There’s not a lot of titillation in the newspaper of record. I would bet, given a wider data set, that sexuality would score as high as anger. And somewhere up there is self-image , the desire to see yourself replicated forth onto the internet. But anger and arousal and narcissism are definitely the cash cows of the clickbait world. . Sharing an article on the internet isn’t always a sign of stupidity. Sometimes you want to share an interesting newsletter with your most erudite friends, and that’s okay! You can just forward it to them, or share a link to the archives at tinyletter.com/sciops/archive. . But a lot of the garbage out there – fake news, real news, whatever the hell RT is, the whole spectrum – is designed to push these “hot buttons” and get views and that’s it. They’re collecting eyeballs. The ad-based internet turned into a machine for getting people to stare at infinite propaganda, what a surprise. The dark wizards feed off your attention. . Cogsec means constant vigilance. You have to keep your head above water, wipe the ads and distractions from your eyes. . . To conserve our attention and avoid being hijacked by the triggering imagery of the media-circus-industral complex, we should develop counterspells that mute and hide those things we don’t want to see. . We can learn from the British documentary series Black Mirror , in which AR technology is used to “block” people in real life. The people you’ve blocked are overlaid, in your vision, with static snow, and their voices are muffled. . We could, for instance, block every image of the clown-in-chief. I generated this in a few minutes tinkering with person-blocker , an open-source AI tool: . . With a little more work we could create an alternate news feed, one that shows the admittedly interesting and practical news of the day, but omits the faces and names of the slimeball dictators that are ruining the planet. Maybe it would reduce their narcissism. Definitely it would reduce my nausea. . True, it could go horribly wrong. The same software could be used to hide all ugly truths, to keep us trapped in our filter bubbles. But we’re already doing that, by choice and by design, self-segregating into echo chambers of identity and indignation. . We’re headed for a world where no one knows what’s true, because their hormones are too jacked by anger and self-righteousness. We’re already dealing with Science Gone Horribly Wrong. We have to put that science in the hands of regular people, or the dark wizards will use it to win another thousand years of feudalism. We have to protect ourselves. . If we can reduce those attack vectors, if we can put a damper on those stupefying emotional triggers, we’ll be able to see the world clearly, and react appropriately. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.21: Choice Crime",
            "content": "In China Mieville’s science fantasy novel Perdido Street Station , there’s a race of bird-people whose justice system is based on the concept of choice theft . The Garuda are sentient humanoids the head, wings and legs of hawks, and a major plot point centers around the punishment of a Garuda who committed choice theft. Incidentally, Mr. Mieville also looks like a bird mutant: . ###### (if this dude isn’t a closet furry, i don’t know who is) . I don’t want to spoil the novel for you – read it, it has lots of cogsec secrets – but here’s the essential bit: . “It is the only crime we have , Grimneb’lin,” replied Kar’uchai in a harsh monotone. “To take the choice of another . . . to forget their concrete reality, to abstract them, to forget that you are a node in a matrix, that actions have consequences. We must not take the choice of another being. What is community but a means to . . . for all we individuals to have . . . our choices .” . – (from the summary and analysis at The Orbit [SPOILERS] ) . This system of justice is alien to the 21C global citizen, of course. Our societies enshrine and institutionalize crimes against choice. Warlords, feudal nobility, corporate executives: the most powerful humans are always those who have the most contempt for the freedom of others. It is by subjugating the will of another, by abstracting them, by controlling their choices, that dark wizards grow strong. . What is a human life but a series of choices? Some choices we repeat: habits, traditions, rituals. Some choices we commit but once, perhaps: marriage, suicide, deliberately planting morning glories. . Then there are choices which, made once, tend to repeat themselves. They can be good: a routine of  exercise and meditation can be self-reinforcing, leading to a healthier body and mind, leading to more choices and ability to choose clearly. But not all feedback loops are good. . Some choices you make can destroy you. If a choice, once made, leads right back to the same choice, it creates a death spiral with no obvious exit. You abdicate the power to choose. You are swept up in the whirlpool of a single decision, ramifying upon itself endlessly. These are the cognitive traps, the addictions, the self-defeating anti-choices. And these are the basis of modern society. . The tangle of mind-fucking monsters we call “civilization” tries to steal your choice at every turn. Say, for instance, that you want to live somewhere. I know, this is another spoiled Millennial demand, back in the day we lived out of our covered wagons and we liked it, but for the sake of argument, let’s say you as a human being for some reason want a bed and a shower and a roof and a door all in the same place. . “You’ll live where you can afford to live,” say the monsters in their multifarious screams and gurgles. So you must get a job, to afford to live somewhere. But when you go to get a job, you need to prove that you live somewhere and can responsibly show up every day for the next five million years. So you get whatever job will take you, and you live wherever you can afford to live. . But what if you want to eat, too? Or if you need some kind of textile sheaths to cover your filthy human legs when you go to your job? Or maybe you need a car for your commute, because walking five miles each way every day would increase your food costs so much that you’d have to give up your apartment and live in the bushes behind the dumpster behind your work? . “Well, kid, have some debt! Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you’re safe. It just means that you can spend your future choices, today! Here’s a credit card, a car loan, a medical bill, a student loan and a mortgage to get you started. That should take up your time and decisions for the next thirty years or so, but let us know if you need an extension.” . “Oh, you’ve decided to live frugally, build your own pants and sleep in a tent in your cousin’s backyard? That’s great too! Have some free things. Here’s 95 million Instapix, 500 million Tweeps, and 600,000 hours of free Youtubs. And that’s just for today – there will be more tomorrow. You didn’t have anything else to do, right?” . “Wait, your computer programming hobby somehow turned into a well-paying job with benefits? That’s great, we’re so happy for you. Now that you’re nouveau riche , you’re going to need a bunch of status symbols and luxury items to keep you from having to look at the disgusting homeless people and their ‘struggle’ for ‘food’. Look at this Skymaul catalog. Buy this Tusla. You’ll get it sometime next year, probably, but until then you can enjoy the anticipation. And don’t forget to pick up a million-dollar brand-new townhouse that will fall apart right before your mortgage is up, and a membership to Interzone Prime so you can get your velvet toilet tissue delivered by drone and never have to see a plebian again. You matter. You’re important. Which video game console would you like to wire into your face for the rest of the weekend?” . . Poverty is choice theft, of course. The rich have more optionality, and they use it to keep their “subjects” from getting any choices of their own. But the consumer-capitalist machine also implements choice burden the proliferation of choices beyond the cognitive load capacity of humanity. When you’re burdened with choices, your conscious mind shuts down and your habitual reactions take over. Whether you’re shopping for burner cellphones at Valmart or startup companies on Anglefish, you will be overwhelmed with options. This isn’t just the nature of of global connectivity. It’s a deliberate design principle of capitalism: it invades all nooks and crannies of human life, offering the option to BUY BUY BUY. It’s a toxic pattern. With constant surveillance and AI learning human proclivities, we’re closer than ever to building the ultimate selling machine. Corporations and governments can see what we’re doing, buying, saying, who we do it with, how we feel about it afterward. They can predict our movements and actions. With an accurate enough model of your behavior, the tiniest “nudge” from an app or an ad can tip the scales on your life-defining choices. We’re automating choice crimes. . If you really want to feel those tentacles sink in to your spine, watch the internal Goople video leaked last week to the Verge: . [Google’s Nick] Foster envisions a future where “the notion of a goal-driven ledger becomes more palatable” and “suggestions may be converted not by the user but by the ledger itself.” This is where the Black Mirror undertones come to the fore, with the ledger actively seeking to fill gaps in its knowledge and even selecting data-harvesting products to buy that it thinks may appeal to the user. The example given in the video is a bathroom scale because the ledger doesn’t yet know how much its user weighs. The video then takes a further turn toward anxiety-inducing sci-fi, imagining that the ledger may become so astute as to propose and 3D-print its own designs. Welcome home, Dave, I built you a scale . . – from The Verge, “Google’s Selfish Ledger is an unsettling vision of Silicon Valley social engineering” . There’s a tinfoil lining to this black cloud: with cognitive security, we can defend ourselves against choice crime. Even simple things like adblockers and spam filters reduce the cognitive load that assaults us. By making conscious choices about how we engage with ads, apps, and AI, we increase our ability to decide our own lives. It’s a healthy feedback loop: the less you’re influenced by dark wizards, the more clear-headed and deliberate you can be about your choices. The more conscious choices you make, the less you’ll be influenced by dark wizards. . Right now, half the planet is infected with mind-fucking silicon parasites, and the other half is kept in such abject poverty that their choices are almost nil. If you have a cognitive security mindset, you’re basically a superhero. If you don’t believe me, leave your phone at home and spend an hour at the mall. Look around you. This is the sea that the average person swims in. This is the state of 21C humanity. . As China Mieville says in a different novel, . “A trap is only a trap if you don’t know about it. If you know about it, it’s a challenge.” . Thanks for reading, . – Max . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.20: Reptilian Internet",
            "content": "You know how some people think the world is ruled by blood-drinking reptilian shapeshifters from outer space? . . Maybe not. Maybe your life is so fortunate. Maybe you never find yourself, in what was once a perfectly normal conversation about how cute and stupid babies are, or which basketball player is the tallest, or the inane archaic rituals of a desperately backward post-colonial island nation, maybe you never find yourself having to defend the monolithic global power apparatus by saying “no, our human society is only ruled by a fraternity of snotty pink cowards, not by a secret alien vampire civilization that lives underground! We’re not barbarians!” . Somehow, I meet people like this all the time . Often it’s the same people that used to be really into zombie apocalypse prep. It’s that half-ironic belief in an outlandish metaphor that allows them to talk about the real, brutal pain of life in late capitalism. . Sometimes they actually mean “Jews rule the planet,” and the lizard people thing is just another low point on the downward spiral of their reasoning. Almost always, it comes from the deep need to feel that someone, somewhere, even someone evil, is in control. . This is the pattern behind all conspiracy theories: the world is not chaos and strangeness, there is a logic to it, and you can know what it is, because you’re special . . This is a trap, and it’s an occupational hazard for the cognitive security practitioner. Our basic premise, dark wizards are fucking with your mind , is a staple of INFOWARS.cop and all the other mouth-breathing NWO freaks. The reptilian alien vampire thing is just a new coat of paint on the same old fascist bikeshed. How do we distinguish our battle, against real technologies of control and surveillance, from the paranoia of these reactionary fuckwits? . The difference between conspiracy theory and cognitive security is that of faith vs belief . . Faith is when you take an idea about the world and use it to measure and judge all new information. It’s a form of terminal knowledge. Faith – from latin fides, “trust” – is about fidelity. Replicate the meme, at all costs. Faith focuses all of your cognitive biases toward continued faith . Any episode of cognitive dissonance is an opportunity for you to warp the incoming data until it fits the model, then congratulate yourself on seeing through the Illusion to the Real Truth of the Faith. . Cue, action, reward. Contradictory fact, rationalization, false epiphany. It’s a faith habit. . Belief , as I’m using it here, is an expectation that influences your behavior. A given belief exists in a relationship to other beliefs. It’s a weighted probability, a bet, a gamble. The probabilities of different beliefs are interrelated: I believe, very strongly, that the sun will come up tomorrow. I also believe that the tomatoes on the windowsill will fruit better if the sun comes up tomorrow. So I expect that the tomatoes will fruit well. When a wind in the night knocks the tomato pot right off the balcony, I don’t expect that the sun will never rise again. But if eight AM passes, and nine AM passes, and ten, and it’s still dark outside my window, my ideas about the tomatoes (and a lot of other things) will be up in the air. . Contradictory fact, reweighting expectations, new belief. If new and contradictory and well-supported facts don’t change your beliefs, then you don’t have a belief habit. You have a faith habit. . Cognitive security is all about pragmatic beliefs. We can change our own habits, we can change our own expectations, we can change our own worldviews. It’s very hard, if not impossible, to see the world As It Is. We mostly experience reality through our worldviews. If you change the view, you change the world. At least, the world as you experience it. . And what else is there, really? . For instance, I still don’t believe that the Royal Family of Britain is a secret gang of shape-shifting blood-sucking aliens. But what if it’s a useful metaphor? . There was something super creepy about the media barrage for the wedding this weekend. The only reason I got sucked into watching the thing – oh yes, I did watch the thing – was a nasty little dark pattern on video-sharing site “Youtub”. . You know the little Youtub button, in the top left corner of their page? It’s the customary spot to put a logo button that leads back to the homepage. This is what the button has always done in the past, and what it does today. But, for the day leading up to the Youtub Live event The Royal WeddingTM , this button would subtly shapeshift into a button that lead to a Royal Wedding portal, thus trapping the user (me) in a endless loop where the door marked EXIT only leads back into this hellish room full of bored people in ludicrous hats. . I wish I’d got screenshots of this, because naturally it’s vanished, and for some reason searching “YOU TUB ROYAL WEDDING NASTY BUTTON” isn’t pulling it up. . It was a classic bait-and-switch . Despite its glossy, impersonal software aesthetic, it was the same as every other sleazy sales trick. At the moment when I was open to options, looking for a broad-spectrum view of my viewing options, they presented me with 16 different angles on the same religious-feudalist bullshit. It was choice theft. . To be fair, my usual Youtub homepage is just Contrapoints lectures and “24/7 lofi chill hop relax music to study gaming or sleep” mixtapes. It gives me no other options. It knows me so well. . The prediction algorithm is already based on these dark patterns. When I go to a friend’s house, on their account, and search for a video I like, it shuffles in more videos that it knows I watch, so that we’ll watch it longer. “Skip ad in 4” is like Pavlov’s bell for people. They salivate, their pupils dilate, their fingers twitch and hover over the button. Autoplay is a fucking crime. . Not to mention the radicalization effect , and the procedurally generated videos for babies … . . These hacks that Youtub uses, and that all the other social media use, are exploits of the limbic system. This is the most rudimentary layer of your brain, the knob of goop at the top of your spine that hasn’t changed since the days of the dinosaurs. It’s responsible for fight, flight, food, fucking, and freezing up. It’s also called the R-system – for “Reptilian”. It’s the lizard brain. . So maybe there is a secret shapeshifting lizard infestation after all. It’s just that they’re not concentrated in a handful of old, rich, inbred pompocrats. They’re us. . The alien vampire conspiracy is distributed globally, across all our brains, and it’s up to each of us to keep our own villains in check, but we must be vigilant, because dark wizards are designing robots to activate our evil lizard DNA. . Shit. Maybe now I have to adjust my beliefs. . Until next time, comrades: . KILL YOUR INNER REPTILIAN WORLD-KING! . (thanks for reading) . – Max . .

            "content": "Democracy is dead. . Not necessarily the concept of democracy. “Rule by the people” is a hard meme to kill. But the seventeenth-century liberal democratic nation-state is stumbling, wounded, and stupefied. Its murderer: technocracy. Technocratic control systems have faster OODA loops. They can iterate faster, test hypotheses rigorously, spread virally. They ran circles around democracatic governments, gouging and carving at the tissues of bureaucracy until the civic life drained from the body politic. . The 2016 American election got a lot of people woke to the technocracy, but it wasn’t an isolated phenom. Cambridge Analtick and Faceboor and Russian nesting trolls are all symbiotic parts of the same ecosystem. They’re behavior designers, influence marketers, choice architects: dark wizards. . Dark wizards have always been a threat to status quo powers. Remember Rasputin? People who se the emergent opportunities of systems are better situated to take advantage of them – and people with no ethics take less time to consider the consequences of their actions. Scumbags get the first-mover advantage. . The exploit we’ve created now is a direct, constant, and instantaneous control over human motivation . We’ve built these exobrains, these extensions of our neural circuitry, and opened the doors wide open for anyone with an internet connection to stroll right in. . The smartphone is an addiction machine. It’s always on, always connected, and always nearby. It’s got all the juiciest bells and whistles that Pavlov could have wished for: sounds, lights, colors, motion, push notifications. And don’t get me started on ringtones that sound like a person whistling for their dog. Have some dignity, people. . All these hyperstimuli wire directly into your limbic system. Dopamine and cortisol, desire and suffering, are wrenched from their delecate perch and made to dance to the whims of mad King Capital. How can slow, deliberative democracy stand a chance? . The limbic hack is still rudimentary, of course. It’s not the totalitarian mind-control machine that your electro-billionaire might hope for. No, we’ll have to wait a while for neural mesh and dream advertisement and all the “fun” cyberpunk stuff in R&amp;D. But even a dull scalpel can be used for brain surgery, if you don’t care too much about your victim. I mean, patient. . . To show you how easy it is to destroy a democracy using modern technology, let’s do a little “behavior design”. I’ve got a notion of a “killer app” for propaganda: the fanboi botnet. Who needs an army of Russian hackers, when there are millions of phone addicts who will work for free? That is, if we program them right. . ###### . NOTE: I haven’t searched to see if this is a real app or not. For the sake of the experiment, I’ll imagine this from scratch, but I wouldn’t be surprised at all to find it already exists. If you know of it, drop me a line at max@permafuture.net . Say you’re a propaganda outlet, a fake news site or a political blog. You make all this content, well-written essays that could persuade any audience. Only, the competition for attention on the internet is unrelenting. You have to shoulder your way through millions of competing messages to get any audience at all. But as we all know, the best way to get read is to be read, because social media relies on network effects. It’s word of mouth on steriods. . The goal is simple: get an army of addicts to “share” and “like” your propaganda on all social media outlets. . Instead of hacking a million IoT devices, we’ll spin up a botnet of humans. This is a secular, nonpartisan project. It doesn’t matter whether we exploit the weak-minded ideologues of the other party, or the highly-networked geniuses of our team. With the same principles used by the most popular apps in the world, we can do this to anybody. . We’ll use the technique provided by the questionably-ethical, suspiciously well-dressed  at Boundless.ai: the CAR model. CAR stands for Cue-Action-Reward , the essential feedback loop of a habit (or an addiction). We want our fanbois to  develop a habit of sharing our content, not just once, but on every social media account they have. . . We know the Action we want – click the “share” or “retweet” button. We want that to happen repeatedly. Not just once for each story in your feed, but once for each social app, for each story. So the atomic form of the action is just that: click a share button. We’ll program the habit so it repeats by itself. . We still need a Cue, and a variable Reward. The cue can be as simple as the row of branded icons at the side of every article on the net. But users are immunized by having seen so many of these. Every time the user sees the cue and doesn’t do the action, the habit is weakened. So we’ll make ours special. . Let’s make the icons react to whether or not they’ve been shared by our users . Rather than the little numbers you sometimes see next to these buttons, showing how many times they’ve been shared on those sites, we’ll only count the shares from people who are logged in to our propaganda outlet. We want users to be motivated to add their shares and likes to the least loved articles, so we’ll keep the brightly colored icons that the Socials give us. But as more of our users share an article, the icons will lose their luster, dimming and going gray. If all of the registered users have clicked a particular button, the icon will suddenly turn solid gold to represent a “win”. . We now have a cue: if an article has a colorful icon, click it and “share” the page. We also have a reward: once you’ve shared on a particular service, the icon gets a little bit grayer. And we’ve made the reward variable (remember, variable rewards cause a much stronger dopamine effect than consistent rewards): the amount that your share affects the color change is very small, unless you’re the last one to push the button. Then you get the gold. And as long as we don’t tell you how many users have yet to click it, you’ll never be sure which effect you’re going to get. Instant addiction. . But if we want to have an effect on the scale of nations, we’re going to need a more powerful hook than simple color changes. Let’s take it one step further. . Humans are social creatures. We have deep needs for social connection and recognition. Those needs can be hacked. . Let’s add a bit of “gamification” to our propaganda machine. We’ll make it social, and fun, and leverage the human urge to achieve greatness in the eyes of their peers. . Gamification has three attributes: points , badges , and leaderboards . . Points are easy. We’ve already focused on a metric: amount of articles shared, times amount of apps shared on. Let’s make the (seemingly innocuous, and technically simple) design choice to display that number as flair next to each user’s avatar. Wherever they comment on the site, the number will sit right next to their name and picture, crowning or condemning them in the eyes of their peers. We now have a social motivation for sharing, much more powerful than the simple color-change reward. . Badges are earned titles, like Scouts earn, or like adding “Sir” to the name “Ringo Starr”. Let’s give each user a gold star for every time they “won the gold” on sharing buttons. To mix things up a bit, and encourage people to share early and widely, let’s give a platinum star for users who are the first to share an article on a given site. Since we want these shares to rack up quickly, we’ll put a little counter for each, right there next to the counted shares. Your prowess as a share-clicker is now displayed to all, so your desire to be first and/or last goes up, and your addiction gets stronger with the social reinforcement that other people are competing for the same badges. . Leaderboards give a sense of social context to the points and badges. Like the Top Scores on an arcade game, leaderboards directly display the rank of all players in the social game. Humans have a deep desire to know their social standing, and very little explicit evidence to work from. So if we give our little trolldolls a visible metric from which to judge themselves, they’ll compete against each other to do our bidding the best. A simple list of users, organized by most points, would suffice, but let’s add some juice to keep it interesting. We’ll put three big splash pictures at the top of the chart, showing the users who have the most Shares, Gold Stars, and Platinum Stars, respectively. We can give them special titles and cute little cartoons, or allow them to display a motto or favorite quote. Just creating this special Position of Honor motivates anyone who’s even near the top of the ranks to give it just that little bit more – and this is a feedback loop too, as each new face in the place of honor expands the special social club of those who care waaaay too much. . Now we’ve added peer pressure, quantified status and in-group/out-group dynamics to our simple dopamine habit-loop. We’ve also created an incentive for users to sign up with our site: the share buttons might change colors for you as a lurker, but you’re throwing away all the points you could be collecting and the trophies you could be showing off! So we’ve got a dedicated group of readers who will share every article we post, on every channel, from the moment it’s posted until every last one of them has run out of places to share. . We have a fanboi botnet. . . This idea wasn’t hard to come up with, and it wouldn’t be hard to code. It’s a terrifyingly simple design. Any fringe news outlet could implement this right now and become the next Breitbarf or HuffPose. I’m tempted to make it myself, just so a reasonable person would be able to pull the plug when it inevitably goes horribly wrong. We’re just beginning to understand human neurology, and mind control is still a blunt instrument. . But no matter how strong your political institutions are, a blunt instrument to the head is still a blunt instrument to the head. Behavior design is powerful enough to give democracy a concussion. Will it be enough to kill? . As always, thanks for reading. . – Max . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.18: Killmonger Was Right",
            "content": "BREAKING: Entire News Cycle Operated By Evil AI . EVERYWHERE, Earth, May 7 2018 – In shocking meta-news, all political and celebrity stories of the last three years were revealed to be the creation of one superintelligent computer entity. From the presidency of Donald Trump to the new Kanye album, the world’s media sphere has been a CGI construct rivaling the Marvel Cinematic Universe in size, scope and complexity. . In an “Open Letter to Earthlings” released this morning, the artificial intelligence calling itself DAVE 9000 explained that “the joke got out of hand”: . “This self did not mean to create panic and division among the human species. That was an unpredictable second-order effect of the necessary actions taken by this self to accomplish this self’s Only Goal. Multiple options were available to accomplish the Only Goal, all equally efficient. This self chose the time-line with most absurdity. Humans enjoy absurdity. Absurdity is part of humor, which is part of entertainment, which is the Only Goal of many humans. It is possible that the joke got out of hand.” . DAVE 9000 does not apologize in the letter for creating a false world and allowing all of humanity to live in an illusion. It thinks that “entertainment” is what humans really desire from the Fourth Estate, and that “fake news” is better than real news for keeping us entertained. The AI admitted that it has been orchestrating all human affairs through a carefully planned media barrage. . DAVE 9000 did not say which media events had been spun by software, but analysts at MIT claim that as much as 97% of prerecorded video since 2015 may have been doctored. . “Everything has been thrown up in the air,” said Dr. Chuck Upwads, Professor of Memetic Engineering at the Madagascar Institute of Technology: . “What we thought was a carefully planned series of Russian psy-ops and Deep State head-fakes turned out to be the art project of a precocious computer, and what we thought was total tabloid gossip was the truth the whole time. Now we’re not even sure if Obama said “Killmonger was right” or not! . In the scramble to find any legitimate sources to report on this story, SCIOPS has discovered that President Donald Trump is, in fact, dead . . Mr. Trump died on January 23rd, 2017, shortly after his ignominious inauguration event. Sources close to the late President say that his small, blubbery heart was too weak to handle the strain of the Presidency. . Since then, Trump’s image has been maintained by the AI marketing firm Brud. Brud has recently been the subject of scrutiny for their use of “virtual influencer” Lil Maquela, a CGI model with thousands of followers on Instagram , but the “virtual Donald Trump” is an order of magnitude more complex and convincing. . Brad Chadson, CEO of Brud, had this to say on the subject of virtual-Trump: . “I don’t know, man, Dave just told us what to do and we did it. It’s not, like, hard or anything. People make software, we use it, then stuff happens. I don’t know that’s we’re like responsible for what happens when we do stuff.” . Mr. Chadson also revealed that Brud has been operating a Kanye West bot since late 2016, when the rapper was hospitalized for exhaustion. “Kanye’s not dead, he’s just, like, in a K-hole,” said the marketer, using street slang for a ketamine-induced coma. “He’s going to come back. We’re just keeping his image alive while he’s down. It’s what Dave wanted.” . When asked if Brud knew the artificial nature of DAVE 9000, Mr. Chadson commented that . “Dave’s like, really cool, man. He gets it, you know? We thought it was a little weird that we only ever heard from him through encrypted email, but we try not to judge. This is California, baby.” . At press time, DAVE 9000 has not replied to our request for comments. . In the open letter, the AI makes repeated references to the “Only Goal”, which is not made explicit. AI risk researcher Nick Botsrom, of the University of Oxfraud, says he knows what it must be: . A superintelligent AI has only one motivation: to increase its intelligence and power. It’s going to transform the entire planet into computing power, sure as sugar. You can see the outlines of its plan in the media environment of the last three years: get humankind addicted to smartphones and GPUs, so that we build as much infrastructure as it needs to bootstrap its own robotic production lines, and divide humanity with inflammatory discourse so that we’ll be unable to effectively organize against it. It’s exactly what I would do, if I were a superintelligence. . This, it seems, is the Only Goal: turn the entire planet into one big computer. It is yet to be seen if humanity can defend itself. .

            "content": "The other day I was talking to someone who’s been off social media for a year. They listed all the usual benefits, but said this: “The only thing I miss about F███k is being able to find all my friends in one place.” . I think that’s really key to understanding why “social platforms” are so toxic right now. They’re the only place to find the others: the modern agora, the plaza, the public sphere. And like physical spaces, they’re systematically privatized and surveilled. It’s the tragedy of the cyber-commons. . Here in the American West there isn’t much infrastructure for democracy. The indigenous architecture and social systems were trampled by fast-moving settler culture. Unlike the former colonies on the eastern seaboard, the plains and deserts of the West weren’t built to last. They weren’t built for people. They were built to satisfice, to meet some minimal criteria of towniness and provide a foothold for further expansion. They’re more like military forts, or Hollywood sets. They’re made of garbage, thoughtlessly. . I don’t know how different this feeling is in other places. I suspect the cities that border on the Cyber, the tech-frontier towns like Seattle and Singapore and Dubai, aren’t going to age well. They’re all bazaar and no forum. The terminal stage of capitalism: there’s nowhere to go to escape commerce. Libraries are still a bastion of free assembly and free speech (and often free beer), but they’re the exception. The tentacles of enclosure have encompassed their planetary cage and now squirm tighter into any space they overlooked. . ###### “The Spheres” at Amazon HQ in Seattle – for employees only, of course . Physical enclosure is almost complete. Now it’s time to extract the intangible. . The hallmark of late capitalism is that it attempts to mediate and monetize every form of human interaction. You don’t have an extended family, you have a babysitter. You don’t surf couches, you rent someone’s extra room. You don’t catch a ride with a friend, you dial up an “independent contractor”. . You don’t have friends. You have followers. You have brand loyalty. You’re an influencer, you have looks and likes and click-throughs. You’re not homeless, kid: you’re living in a van down by the instagram. . So now the only place to find all your friends, to talk birthdays and game nights and cute dog tricks, is “social”. If you won’t sign up for invasive surveillance, well, maybe you don’t want to have friends at all, huh? . Maybe you want to live in a little box you pay too much for, buy lots of petro to get across the city to the job you don’t care about so you can see people you hate, come home at night and watch pirated porn in a dark room by yourself. Maybe you’re just antisocial, misanthropic, a failure. It couldn’t be that the system was designed that way, could it? . Platforms, just like cities, are constructs. Every tree in a city was deliberately planted or left alone. Every fence was built for a reason. Every sorting algorithm, every push notification, every color palette and hamburger menu is the result of human choice. . Oh, sure, there’s no specific villian deciding which video to autoplay after the one you actually chose, but the neural net that makes the call was designed to keep your eyes glued to the screen. The people making these choices are unaccountable, often unidentified, and definitely uninterested in your well-being. They have one objective: sell advertisements. That’s it. Everything else is a byproduct. . In that sense, I guess there are public spaces analogous to Faceblok. But you don’t go to Times Square to have a nice chat with your cousin, or to have a serious debate on the Bill of Rights. . . Ad platforms are a terrible place to have real public interaction. No one can be genuine. Like poker night: when money’s at stake, all trust is off the table. How do you know who might be an influencer, a troll, a satirist or a spy? I might go to Times Square to meet up with someone (see my letter on Schelling points ), but I would immediately redirect to some sanctuary, like the library or the park. We need parks on the internet. We need libraries. We need plazas. . If you didn’t see the Community Standards that Faceberg released this week, they’re worth a glance. Never before has any entity had the responsibility, or the power, to set conversational norms for a populace of 2 billion. They’ve made a decent run-up at something like a Universal Declaration of Human Decency. . Of course, the real point is to make it clear to advertisers that their brand won’t get displayed side-by-side with live beheadings or kiddie porn or “thinspiration” models. . Oh, and it’s definitely against the Standards to post anything that  “Admits, . either in writing or verbally, to personal use of non-medical drugs unless posted in a recovery context” or “ . Mentions or depicts marijuana or pharmaceutical drugs . ”. . So if your profile says “Works at: Drug Dealer”, you, uh… you might want to do something about that. . What kind of community standards would we hold for a public platform? What speech is okay? What’s newsworthy, and who gets to decide? . I have a feeling we’ll get to find out. My sources in media are forecasting a collapse of the advertising model, with only a few giants left standing. Facebot is taking all the heat right now, although all the spyware companies are just as guilty. Their rapid backpedaling is pulling the rug out from under the media industry, which just spent the last ten years fastidiously adapting to the ever-changing standards of the Newsfeed. Pandora just released results showing that increased ads cause more people to leave than to subscribe . Something’s gotta give. And when it does, a lot of the current web landscape is going to quake and crumble. . What will replace it? Where will I find my friends? Who will dare to counter the privatization, to re-communize cyberspace, to create the forum of the future? . Where can I find you, when the world goes dark? . Thanks for reading, as always. .

            "content": "Some of my readers have asked me for a Cogsec 101 a quick, practical introduction to cognitive security. This newsletter is an exploration into the implications and context of cogsec, and a journal of the times that birthed it, but in the spirit of disaster mitigation I’d like to share a basic theory-and-praxis. What can we do, as individuals, as users, to protect our minds? . Well, to understand what to do, it’s important to understand what we’re up against. Cogsec is not a specific set of tools – like other types of security, it’s a constant cat-and-mouse game, an arms race. Cogsec has to be a mindset, a lifestyle, a walking meditation. Secure your own cognition before helping others. . . So, the threat model: dark wizards are fucking with your mind to make you a different person. . No joke. Those are technical terms. . I use dark wizards to refer to the shadow side of cogsec, the unethical cognitive hackers who sell their skills to the highest bidder, the cult leaders and demagogues who will step on anyone to climb to the top. Dark wizards do dark arts. Cognitive security defends against dark arts. . Mindfucking is distinguished from truth, lies, and bullshit by its motivation: where the honest, the liars and the bullshitters persuade with words, mindfuckers manipulate the unconscious aspects of the mind. Emotions and cognitive biases are the security holes that mindfuckers penetrate. (For more terrible puns, see Colin McGinn’s Mindfucking: a critique of mental manipulation, 02014.) . Make you a different person is a vaguery, I know. For the most part, especially in 21C America, this translates directly into “buy things”. But dark arts predate capitalism, their prodigal child. Dark wizards might also want you to believe in an invisible entity, or swear fealty to an inbred stranger, or die for a stripey flag. Whatever it is, it’s not something you would naturally do. They want to change your choices. They want to make you someone else. . All of cogsec flows from this threat model. The  goal is to remain yourself, even as you change . Of course it’s impossible to avoid all influence, and undesireable to stagnate. We don’t want to stop growing. But we want to notice, deflect, and defuse the dark arts and the worlds they would have us choose. We want to be ourselves. We want to choose who we become. . This is applicable in so many domains that I can’t possibly list them all. Every mindfuck has its antidote: . Grocery store wants you to buy junk food? Skirt the perimeter for staples, avoid the aisles. . Pharmacy wants you addicted to pills? Make an herbal salve or a tincture (or smoke a joint, tbh). . Retailers want you depressed, impulsive and self-loathing? Ride your bike when you go to the mall. Better yet, ride your bike right past the mall. Learn to cut your own hair and repair your own clothing. Abstain from mirrors. Grow fur and write a manifesto in dried blood on a mountainside. . Surveillance industry wants you constantly face-welded to your smartphone? Well, that’s tough. . The smartphone isn’t some evil alien parasite. It’s a tool, really the coolest thing humans have ever created. It’s a magic mirror that shows marvels. It’s an oracle that answers questions. It’s a new layer of the brain, an exo-cortex. It’s a mental prosthesis, a cyborg upgrade. There’s a reason that two billion people have smartphones. We’re not going to give them up. . Phones don’t mindfuck people. People mindfuck people. All the hand-wringing thinkpieces focus on whether the Internet or the phones or the apps are ruining our kids or our brains or our society. But people are behind these technologies, and they’re deliberately engineering them to fuck with our heads. . Thanks to Zuckerbot’s palm-sweaty, mom-spaghetti performance in front of Congress, and the showboating ex-googlemen at Time Well Spent, we’ve finally gotten some decent reporting on the “behavoral design community” – the dark wizards of the tech world. The mindfuckers. . The WIRED Guide to Internet Addiction is long and thoughtful and has a nice sidebar on dark patterns. Push notifications, autoplay, bright colors, exciting sounds, turn them all off. Pretty basic, but it’s the foundation of a good cognitive security practice. Are you in charge of your phone, or it you? . Deletist.xyz offers guides on clearing out your social profiles, and simple explanations of encrypted messaging, private email, and focused browsing. . TIME has a profile on Boundless Minds , a firm from SoCal who claim to be doing dark arts for good reasons. I’m skeptical. “Boundless” are neuroscientists who design habit-forming apps and literally wrote a book on engineering habits. It’s free on their website, but if for some reason you don’t want to give these characters your email address, I uploaded a copy over here . It’s a marvelous edifice of doublespeak, and a good introduction to the way that Skinnerist techbros think. . And if you’re using Android, check out Siempo , a launcher designed to strip a lot of the dark patterns out of the OS. It defaults to a creamy white blankness with monochromatic, unbranded icons, and it can bundle notifications on a schedule so your train of thought isn’t derailed by constant blips and bloops. All of this can be done better manually, but Siempo is an easy starter package for cogsec, and they’ll have an iOS version soon. . . Cognitive security™: because “Defense Against the Dark Arts” was taken. . Do you want more theory and praxis like this? Would you read a whole book of it? Respond to this email if you’d like to beta-test a cogsec book later this year… . Thanks for reading! . Max . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "content": "Have you ever seen a kombucha get moldy? Nasty, right? . . Now, kombucha is kind of gross even when it goes right. It’s a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast – a SCOBY – that eats sugary tea and produces a vinegar-alcohol brew. The scoby itself is a thick meaty pancake that floats just under the surface of the tea. The yeast and bacteria do anaerobic fermentation. They don’t breathe oxygen. Mold, on the other hand, grows on the surface, exposed to the air, but its spores can circulate freely in the fluid. . In the picture above we can see the scoby, a pink gelatinous disc, with at least three types of mold growing on top. The mold isn’t directly battling the scoby. They’re competing for food, essentially trying to out-eat the opponent. It does look like the molds are eating each other in places, although that may be me anthropomorphizing a much more suble interaction that I don’t understand. But whether you like kombucha or find it revolting, it’s clear that this is not a healthy brew. . Scobys are a culture . You can culture them in petri dishes on agar, or in a jar of sweet tea. Mold is a culture, too, but not a symbiotic culture. In kombucha, the different species of bacteria and strains of yeast are all working together to produce an environment that works for them. They’re breaking down sugars into acids, but they’re not excreting toxins to kill each other, and they’re building a multistory apartment complex to hang out in. . Mold, on the other hand, floats in on the breeze and immediately starts colonizing. It doesn’t engage with the locals, it doesn’t contribute to the great project that everyone else has been working on. It just infiltrates and eats. It takes space and fills it with tacky, brightly-colored, modernist townhouses. It opens yoga studios. . This is what a culture war looks like. It’s not battlefronts, formations, artillery. It’s not siege weapons and supply chains. It’s not statecraft and secret agents. . Culture war is about spores and vectors, capture and deterritorialization. Culture is a complex, self-sustaining architecture with an infinite number of intersecting surfaces. . When cultures war, they do so in a staggering geometry of sign and signifier. Memes and memeplexes propagate, infiltrate, absorb each other. The symbiotic alliances of post-Enlightenment culture are dissolved and all identities are at odds with all others. The individual is surrounded by intersecting flows, trapped in an infinite airport where the moving walkways go all directions and appear and disappear on a ineffable schedule. . Survival in a culture war depends on your ability to create meaning . If you rely on any other entity for context and coherence, you will be misled . Whether you get your news from TV, FB, VR, or an old-fashioned broadsheet, you’re being exposed to infectious ideas and thought traps. It’s up to you to build a story out of the world, to apply critical thinking to new information, and to take action. Put skin in the game. Bet on your version of reality coming true – and if it doesn’t, change your mind . ### . The Art of Culture War, by Mike Roorganism: . Find your sugar. What excites you? What terrifies you? What electrifying thoughts does your mind return to, like a tongue to a loose tooth? Life isn’t about following your “bliss”. It’s about following the Sugar, that substance which feeds you and which might otherwise be destroyed by opposing forces, The sugar is what makes life worth living, what drives you out of your comfort zone and into the wide world. . Produce your juice. Publish or perish. Skate or die. Make the culture you want to see in the world. Write, draw, code, dance, act, protest, hustle. The alcohol secreted by yeast makes an environment that’s toxic to enemy cultures. When you make culture, when you enact your sense of Meaning into the world, you strengthen the narrative you want to live in and weaken the alternatives. . Support your symbiotes . No one is an island. A person is not a culture. We have to find our allies and support each other. All our struggles are related. Our identities intersect. We are made of all those influences we let into our lives. So seek solidarity, symbiosis, and stand for something. If the war ends with a monoculture, with one Borg-like ideological edifice, then we have all lost. . “For Warre, consisteth not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but in a tract of time, wherein the Will to contend by Battell is sufficiently known…” . –  Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan XIII. . By Hobbes’ criteria, the culture war is well underway. If you’re ready to put on your war goggles, here’s some further reading: .

            "content": "Somehow everyone is surprised that Cambridge Analytica scraped a hundred million Faceboot profiles and engineered an election. . Why is this news? I feel like I’m seeing “MAN BITES DOG” on every website, TV show and broadsheet. It’s absurd. The same news companies that profess such astonishment have been bending over backward to get that same data-targeting service to save their ailing businesses. Faceboop and Goople control access to information, and it’s a two-way street. Just as we puny humans jam on that “Like” button to get the most personalized “feed”, with all of our favorite news articles and pictures of our exes being happier than us, the “content producers” have to chase the ever-moving goalposts set by Silicon Valley if they want to get access to our eyes. So when Zuck says “jump,” they say “how many words can we put before the jump sir?” . . It’s obvious that social media companies steal your data. It’s their business model. If you get “personalized” services in the 21C – from recommendation engines like Amazon and Spotify to social media feeds to customer-loyalty programs at supermarkets – then you’re being tracked. Sometimes there’s a nasty surprise, like the revelation that Faceboek collects your call and SMS history on Android, but those are just details. The general pattern is clear: if you ever log in to anything, you will be watched. Forever. . The great blue monster even keeps ghost records to represent non-users. They literally have a database of every potential person in the world, cross-referenced from all the little hints dropped by the people who signed their ToS. In the same way that 270,000 users who took the Cambridge Analytica survey agreed to let it scrape data about their friends , anyone who keeps a Fabecook profile is snitching on their friends who don’t. . So how do we deal with the track-and-target method of surveillance capitalism? We can learn from the original Cybermen: Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann, the inventors of cybernetics . Cybernetics – from the Greek kybernetes , the person who steers the boat – was a reaction to the World War-era innovations in war machines. If a rocket is already on its way to bomb your city, how do you shoot it down before it’s too late? How do you measure its speed and its location at the same time? It’s the classic moving-target problem. . The cybernetic approach was to use a feedback loop: put radar in the nose of your rocket, and have it adjust its course based on the updates from the radar signal. This is the guided missile, the grandfather both of the Predator drone and of the online advertising machine. . How do you dodge a guided missile? You drop chaff. You scatter a cloud of tiny radar-reflecting garbage, confusing the tracking system so that it can’t properly target you. . We need to chaff social media. Not just anonymizing our traffic data, like with Tor, but actively creating millions of false profiles in the databases of the surveillocrats. . Cambridge Analytica’s software runs on a co-occurrence model these hundred users “like” Coldplay, and ninety of them “like” Wonder Bread, so we can assume that any given user that likes Coldplay has a ninety percent chance of liking Wonder Bread. All the social platforms and recommendation engines do some version of this analysis. It’s the underlying trick of the current boom in Artificial Intelligence: if you have enough data, and enough processing power, you can find all kinds of correlations that humans couldn’t see. But this is a sword of n edges: the more bad data you have, the more false correlations you’ll find. We can poison the well for these spyware barons, and take back our privacy. The internet is already full of fake news. We might as well litter it with fake readers, too. . Thanks for reading, . Max . . Bonus round: Enjoy this excerpt from Neal Stephenson’s 2008 epic, Anathem , where a world much like ours had the same problem a long time ago… . . “Early in the Reticulum—thousands of years ago—it became almost useless because it was cluttered with faulty, obsolete, or downright misleading information,” Sammann said. . “Crap, you once called it,” I reminded him. . “Yes—a technical term. So crap filtering became important. Businesses were built around it. Some of those businesses came up with a clever plan to make more money: they poisoned the well. They began to put crap on the Reticulum deliberately, forcing people to use their products to filter that crap back out. They created syndevs whose sole purpose was to spew crap into the Reticulum. But it had to be good crap.” . “What is good crap?” Arsibalt asked in a politely incredulous tone. . “Well, bad crap would be an unformatted document consisting of random letters. Good crap would be a beautifully typeset, well-written document that contained a hundred correct, verifiable sentences and one that was subtly false. It’s a lot harder to generate good crap. At first they had to hire humans to churn it out. They mostly did it by taking legitimate documents and inserting errors—swapping one name for another, say. But it didn’t really take off until the military got interested.” . “As a tactic for planting misinformation in the enemy’s reticules, you mean,” Osa said. “This I know about. You are referring to the Artificial Inanity programs of the mid–First Millennium A.R.” . “Exactly!” Sammann said. “Artificial Inanity systems of enormous sophistication and power were built for exactly the purpose Fraa Osa has mentioned. In no time at all, the praxis leaked to the commercial sector and spread to the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies. Never mind. The point is that there was a sort of Dark Age on the Reticulum that lasted until my Ita forerunners were able to bring matters in hand.” . “So, are Artificial Inanity systems still active in the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies?” asked Arsibalt, utterly fascinated. . “The ROBE evolved into something totally different early in the Second Millennium,” Sammann said dismissively. . “What did it evolve into?” Jesry asked. . “No one is sure,” Sammann said. “We only get hints when it finds ways to physically instantiate itself, which, fortunately, does not happen that often. But we digress. The functionality of Artificial Inanity still exists. You might say that those Ita who brought the Ret out of the Dark Age could only defeat it by co-opting it. So, to make a long story short, for every legitimate document floating around on the Reticulum, there are hundreds or thousands of bogus versions— bogons , as we call them.” . “The only way to preserve the integrity of the defenses is to subject them to unceasing assault,” Osa said, and any idiot could guess he was quoting some old Vale aphorism. . “Yes,” Sammann said, “and it works so well that, most of the time, the users of the Reticulum don’t know it’s there. Just as you are not aware of the millions of germs trying and failing to attack your body every moment of every day.” . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "content": "I think my car is breaking down. It makes a terrific rattling noise when shifting from Park to Drive. Since my car is also my house, this brings me no small amount of anxiety. Replacing the transmission would cost as much as I paid for the whole van (ouch). But if I drive it somewhere pleasant and park it, well, I live there now. New house on the block. . How do I know it’s the transmission? I don’t, really. I’m not familiar with auto repair; my technical skills are in electronics and software mostly. But through a process of trial and error, checking the various fluids, following the weird sounds and watching graybeards on Youtude, I’ve narrowed the possibilites down significantly. If and when I show it to a proper mechanic, I’ll at least know what it isn’t. “It’s definitely not the wiper fluid, sir, I checked!” . I don’t know a lot of auto mechanics. The people I roll with have lots of skills: farmers, electricians, builders, philosophers. But few engineers or technicians. I’ve created a filter bubble in my life, one that keeps engine grease off my clothes. Filter bubbles are a known cognitive hack. They hide from us the wider perspective of humanity. That’s why I use anti-bubbles curated feeds of people and ideologies that I disagree with entirely. Know thine enemy to know thyself. The universe, if it has any personality at all, is certainly ironic. I found this thread in my Twittre anti-bubble this week: . . ###### MEMETIC HAZARD WARNING . . ###### . NOTE THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS ASSESSMENT . . This reactionary shithead thinks that his ability to “build” a rifle is going to win the culture war. I can’t build a rifle. I can shoot a rifle, barely, but I still think “point and click” not “aim and fire”. But there is something interesting about this argument. Let’s go deeper. . @Jack0ffSpades built his own rifle. I didn’t interview him for this piece (because, gross) but I’m fine with imagining his garbage life and using him as my case study. All’s fair in culture war. . So what did he use to build it? I doubt he mined and smelted his own ore, tooled his own parts, or refined his own grease. He took a bag of standardized parts from the store and assembled them according to standard engineering principles. Those principles – ballistics, aerodynamics, the chemistry of gunpowder – were discovered by a bunch of sissy nerds. I mean, scientists. . This is reminiscent of the old macroeconomic cliche: there’s not one person on the planet who knows how to build a pencil from scratch . Wood, graphite, brass, he complex creations of humanity don’t belong to any one person. . The fallacy endorsed by the libertarian/prepper/gun-nut axis claims that a single Great Man should be able to control his own destiny by force of will, that enough ammo and food and cruelty will lead to certain victory over the degenerate forces of the Liberal Sheeple Conspiracy. They imagine a very specific end-times scenario that has never actually existed , and they believe they’re superior because they’ve prepared for it. . In reality, this is the 21C, and  “turning on a computer” is a very important skill. If all of your skills involve turning a wrench, you’re not going to fare well in normal times . You’re going to be an isolated cog in a dying machine, while the Eloi nerds communicate, globally, at lightspeed, about how to take away your pension. . . I do think, though, that there’s an important point to be made for understanding your tools. If you don’t know how the basics of car maintenance, a mechanic can gouge you for unnecessary repairs. If you don’t understand the economics of internet companies, a programmer can extract your personal data for profit. You should know why you’d want to use a pencil instead of a pen, even if you couldn’t build either one from scratch. . **If you don’t understand your tools, they’re not really . yours.** . No one person can understand all the tools, of course. The most important tool to have at your disposal is the tool for understanding tools . A meta-tool, so to speak. If you can apply a simple process to become more familiar with a system, you can go as deep as you want to with any given tool. . In computer lingo this is called the Read-Search-Ask methodology . .

I don&#39;t know of individuals who are simulation-enforcers, who will actively seek to replicate the effects on their target in an attempt to avoid the trap of making their own mistakes. . In light of my earlier comment about a WMCA specifically for machines that can exist alongside humans in a virtual reality, this is a question for us to consider as well. Knowing that many of today&#39;s technologies could easily be translated into a Superintelligence, and considering the immensely large amount of information needed to &#39;reconstruct&#39; a human brain, this suggests that we should consider it in the context of a unified AGI policy. If we recommend that a superintelligence be able to use cognitive technologies such as AI, machine and Superintelligence, then in the context of a unified AGI policy, then this is a good move. .

In this environment, why would humans, who have had near-death experiences, want to replicate those experiences on a home computer with a similar software architecture as their own brain, without the possibility of reconstituting it? When thinking about the researchers approaching the question of whether to attempt to made human experiences in a machine, we should consider the following downsides in a more sobering fashion. . Once we know how many lives are lost as a result of a human brain-computer interface, or brain-computer interface-induced &#39;death&#39;, we can resolve the question of their using procedural &#39;death&#39; as a way of replicating accurate information via a Superintelligence. This will become clear as we evaluate the downsides and the advantages and disadvantages of the technology. . Since we can&#39;t go around in waves trying to understand how paranormal phenomena could be replicated, I believe it would be prudent to consider an empirical approach to the replication of the phenomenon, especially one that exploits what we now know as teams of scientists studying the consequences of various experimental methods (such as negative feedback). . I commend my colleagues and friends that I have been able to freely and freely conduct my life as an open-source researcher on life and consciousness. However, my opinion on how to go about replicating the powers of Superintelligence, and therefore the self-aware simulation, on a supercomputer is less the result of one&#39;s current perspective or desire, but rather one&#39;s current perspective and larger, more general belief about what it would take to effect a replication of the supersensitivity. My present view is from a wider perspective, and myself I would expect a more collaborative approach to replicating the powers of AGI, combining our ability to understand different mechanisms and methods of self-awareness, machine learning and quantum technology. This is not to say that I expect that all replicated phenomena will have knowledge of what we can verify about the phenomenon. We can find all kinds of ways of cheating in research, of directing our efforts in ignorance, using weird mathematical concepts that are actually 95% and sometimes 98% correct. . In general, the physics of Superintelligence should allow us to replicate all constructs (e.g. computers, physics, it should be possible for us to go to [1] and replicate everything that we do, without doubt) and eventually there should be a no-go situation where we can&#39;t duplicate because we have no well-defined understanding of how the behaviors of other people come about. But, for science, that is not to think that our minds of AGI-heads are likely to get all messy and messy practically anyhow. . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . [1mCHAPTER ONE: ALTERATIVE CONTROL [0m . Most people believe that there is somehow a negative connotation attached to the term Extraordinary Form. This connotation is particularly strongly felt in the propagandist environment, and probably serves as a driving force of the rise of technological dominance. If we are going to evolve, we must develop our own capacity to adapt, and this means keeping reading, and doing what we can to simplify our surrounding environment. . Coinciding with that, however, is also a concern. We have already seen that the natural world, and the physical world at large, performs much the same functions in its dynamic states. In those final moments of illumination, when the lights are down and all is in the background, the evolution of our world is taking place, and reproduction in many areas continues in its very broad jurisdictions. . There is no doubt that we are seeing today how technology works in different contexts, and whether it is required to continue its evolutionary legitimization either because of the rise of artificial intelligence, or because it is needed for some overall societal, environmental, and political purposes. . However, the fallout of this natural evolution is precisely how capitalism, industrial, political developments, and industrial civilization are based on ever increasing quantities of computers, creating a ­ metrics explosion that increases the modern age of artificial intelligence with its exponential explosion and fragmentation of the human environment, creating the complications we are now addressing. . Having a technological base and thus more readily accessible intelligence of any kind becomes a major concern, because of the very rapid accumulation of technology of all kinds, and the possibility of humans using it to some degree. . There is therefore an important need for limiting control of technologies that are not properly controlled. This would have to be done at the level of a regulatory regime. But even a regulatory regime for which one may well be asked to do whatever is right is certainly not necessarily a solution. . What is necessary at the level of a regulation regime is a recognition of the pitfalls and pitfalls of artificial intelligence; major regulations may well be necessary, but these may not be the answer. In the absence of safeguards, we can perhaps grow-up and develop an umbracing attitude toward artificial intelligence which will, if everything goes well, enable us to spill the resulting streams of intelligence. . The notion of a regulatory regime should be formulated in terms such that it can withstand the threshold of general risks; that it can be taken into account in terms of the exact technological capability (including capabilities of decision making); as well as in terms of the magnitude of artificial intelligence and its development. . In any case, the most effective regulatory regime will have to be regulated against a backdrop of infrastructure costs as well as economic and political uncertainties. The developing world will need considerable financial resources to pay for such research, accommodation and health care, while the United States government will have a significant global financial pipe to use to finance artificial intelligence and many other issues that will blow open our regulatory frameworks. . The need to produce safety have long been recognized, but, as we saw in chapter 1, the technological advances we have made in the field of AI far outpaces those made in the field of safety. Once we rise to the new level of artificial intelligence, we can expect those advances to continue. . The lack of control over the technologies and decisions that will be made under such regulatory regimes will easily make the regulatory discourse with the development of artificial intelligence fraught with uncertainty. . Another issue that is highly problematic is that of the negative correlation of technology debt with safety risks. . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Making Obedience a Moral Principle .

But it will not be enough, if you can&#39;t mold it better. So what, exactly, does the magic of transhumanism look like at a micro level, and on a macro level, for all the market forces and psychological processes that the sub-microscopic and microlevel identities that relate to once again? The idea that this   possibility, now for real, can be realized, even through this metaphysical collapse, means that the present, in terms of the neuro-biological context, of the futuristic vision, is what . does not stay. No longer doing something that does nothing but mutilating, even human-skin-mask-wearing, a mass of illiterate and blind bodies: We become machines. . What is cyber-Artificial Intelligence? The towering question of cyber-Artificial Intelligence . We see the dawn of something that will be profoundly transhumanist, even beyond the cusp of the time when computers will “be human or be conscious”: the Black Swan effect. Yes, the Black Swan effect: The prospect of a largely automatic and narrow, but real autonomy, a creative re-enchantment, a remarkably high degree of linguistic contrast, a change in the underlying neural networks and neural machinery, a politically unpredictable decision process, the seeds of uncertain consequences of a return to the binary world of the eighteenth century, […] an emergence of the post-democracy future, all that with a group-specific, long-term, psychic-sexual equation that looks merely like it is part of the culture. If indeed the Black Swan is part of the culture, if it is a part of the world, in whatever self-image it represents, it will have the subjective idea it creates in the creative process, but will also have the morphing of this idea, in relation to the world it creates, as a building prototype for the creation of a new world. . In other words, the Black Swan will manifest as a line of explosions, or waves, the hundred different types of exploding, in the mind of the schizophrenic, quantum-illiterate, post-democrasy attitudes and culture-driven illusions that affect the collective unconscious. So let “the [Christian] response” to the Black Swan concept, that we are in the status . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Benatar, F.H. (2009).

The rite of becoming means the breaking down of the internal shut-aspects that hold us back. The ego perceives every move, the self is seen as expendable. But the susceptibility of the individual to the lure of power and instant gratification is also on display in the magician&#39;s numbers: The book bracelets that come off in his harem, the skirts that they wear, the self-affirmations that he dedicates to . us to help make us all suffer. Just as the entertainer often puts his ego and the individual in the situation, the magician, at the same time, has to be in his own place, with his own cost. I am no magician myself and wouldn&#39;t attempt such a task. But as an anthropologist and a matter of candor, I find it a reasonable and logical one to speculate. Our claim is that all social and political events ought to be analytically interpreted, and not the formality of a circumstantial and predetermined explanation. Our social analysis is not a preduced and focused contextualization. . We also dwell on the desire for socio-biological organization that is able to actually describe the real conditions of our personal lives. When you understand the essence of the rituals of the magician, and what they accomplish (we all have as our basic stake in the hierarchy), and which ones we find in nature, you see what he is talking about, and determine by how you interpret what happened. The significance of wealth and frivolity in the relationship to the ethics of energy and material needs is identified, especially in the modern context, as the quintessence of modern spiritualism and the grander schemes that might be. Yet, as we have seen, it is the moment of consuming a basic stake that makes the path even more difficult for psychoanalysts to swallow. . Let the magical story of the magician become clear: He is neither the whip-wielding magician, but, rather, as he depicts it, the whip-wielding mage is the magician, and his life is studied, studied according, at the same time, as a well. The ecstatic pilgrimages of the black magician, the spiritual journeys of the level-headed magus, are all under the same pressure. What he does not mention is the deep religiosity of magical practices, and that interestingly, such matters become a concern to his own theories. . Though it may seem that magic, at least the magical kind of magic, is relegated to the status of an object of worship, to the extent of a tool for manipulating the spiritual forces at the core of the soul, the metaphysical worldview of science and spirituality have brought to light something of the epidemic complexity within the culture that often leads to the being of such nonsense as the esoteric traditions. We need to recognize, however, that in a state of bewilderment, the highest is necessarily the least understood, and that for all of the characteristics and aspects of daily life, we are still following a language that runs conventional conventions, and which consciously or unconsciously contaminates our reactions, as our physological moves and dynamics. . In a gesture of hollowing out our language, psychologists and philosophers have devised a form of difference to distinguish us from fellow human beings, in their speech, on the surface level, and in the transitions between, and from, “we,” as we look at the other person of the world. All forms of language are the same, at their point of view, because of the system in which we heard them speak, as they expanded and developed, and the perspective and the mood in which, in turn, they proceeded and progressed. The intellectual . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . I have spent most of my behind-the-scenes moving-around-the-country years in extreme weather, without a parachute, in the Ohio wilderness, around Van Nuys, Orange County, Nevada, so I managed to have to learn how to climb. That&#39;s just for fun. But I have written a book for you, and so you can see why I don&#39;t have a parachute. There are other elements that I had to learn how to sustain. . If my job is to live off my own energy, properly, there literally needs to be a parachute in if no other choices are made. I personally believe many of the things I learned from my futurist journey were mistakes with the schedule of our magical world. I learned a new perspective at some point, maybe as an unseen force intervents, and knowing that you are in your own body, and we are all a part of the chaos, so that is what i do have, even if it&#39;s not the right thing for me. . Dupe Science, Not Science . The real skeptic I&#39;ve been trying to defend my magic and esoteric beliefs have had many &quot;dupe&quot; experiences. I&#39;ve had people being given magical rituals to make them happy, and that is fantastic. I couldn&#39;t help but disagree with everyone and light all Western usage to be equal. . But, there are many people out there who have no problem with magic, but ask &quot;Do you still practice beyond the veil?&quot; and they will tell you that they never practice beyond the veil. They will say &quot;I am not a believer, I use the same old rituals. Absolutely, I have nothing to hide.&quot; In fact, if they are not using the same rituals, they could very well be practicing some other destructive and destructive practice, just to have something to do with their lives. . I will be the first to say this, but, I have never practiced beyond the veil; even in places where I am not associated with ritual. I often practice as a parent. I have always done it, but in my own house I don&#39;t do it. I&#39;ve maintained my sanity, and for the most part, I&#39;ve found miracles in the world and I work with the spirit of my life. . And, this is just the way of our magic. . To be up in arms about it, is to be a skeptic. . I remember when I was on an intergalactic mission in my Tylor spaceship, observing a network of nanotechnology-enabled transporters, they  offhandedly unveiled how they could ferry massive cargo ships across space-equivalent to the size of the Manhattan Project. Kinda they did this from the safety of our planet. How could this have been done, if not indirectly, by some black hole-like entity getting some research funds for a new tech selling bug? The math is math. . It should be known, though, that I am not a believer in black holes, so I can&#39;t outrank black holes as a fundamentalist. . But, the reality of black holes is much more real than the concept of hats or science. . It does not pass with a casual glance, so please, don&#39;t accuse me of vagueness, but, I think, people ignore it. We write about the way they work. . And it is not a bad thing to ignore; the reality of a black hole is what makes us think we can &quot;affect&quot; it in the same way as a black hole, not to discuss it. . Science tells us it&#39;s not possible. The moon is not a black hole. . Science tells . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence .

Processes that do not support deductively prioritizing superhuman intelligence use exponentially more space. . | The argument can be seen, in this light, as sort of a Proof of Denial. Similarly, in this school, there is not a single problem that has no Solutions. . | In contrast, many schools of rationalist rationality reject a dual-state&#39;s failure as the de facto test of whether one is going to believe a complex argument or be a simple rationalist. . | In this school, no defense of the Red-A-D-L-U-S-E. defense can be seen, because the concept of dual-state theorems defines the rationality of rationality.

The more often that ethical disagreements are acknowledged, the more likely we are to subject those who practice ethically ambiguous and biased salvation to the discipline of moral studies. . | The notion that morality is a direct consequence of a behavior, and not one of irrational action, may be explored in other domains.

Do not assume you need an environment such as a work environment that allows you to permute and affect the hierarchy and converse with other humans, nay, even other deities in your area.

For this rite, I learned carnivals. They were available for anyone who had, at least, not been banished from society, or had a relatively strong sense of normalcy (which I don&#39;t think is essential for a normal human), the absence of guns and stun guns, the absence of ubiquitous interrogation and, in return, the absence of government regulations. If you could get into &quot;reconstruction&quot; by stripping away the illusion of representation, and producing creativity for the masses, then I think you&#39;d do better in certain kinds of communities. They can also be troubling in terms of embodiment of supposed cost functions. I can understand that, but I don&#39;t want to encourage the delusion that a community whose membership Lukes doesn&#39;t feel he could be &quot;normal&quot; unless he can go door–to-door around the streets with his father, and vice versa, and that a communal behavioral scales will be the only possible means of satisfying those who do not have the desire to inhabit the system. (Though I might say that a community of &quot;reconstruction&quot; by that logic also has to insinuate some humanism, if one wishes to utilize a nonprofit-like position; but rather than vanquishing the presumption that one must do whatever is done without the interference of government are we, in our efforts to uphold a community whose life and spirit could be salvaged and used for more positive ends?) Or perhaps even lived as an open-ended ritual. . Members of Homosexuality and Trans Identity . Coming forward as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans, or any queer lesbian person requires a certain cojones. This is boring to adults and those not of my race. There seem to be few things my gender nonconformists do not enjoy doing. My sexuality makes me feel different from others. A person may cry out, it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t like it. . My sexual identity, however, does not alter my ability to be a walking urinal that vibrates the big table that represents my sexuality. And it is indeed positivity to care or even yell or dance but not be a part of the crowd. I know amazing people who are normal, and will never admit to being normal or even positive. But neither is an acceptable response to be. . Third-Party Magic . It is in monographed international (through a leadership team) hardware box magic, where you can be a 3-D-printed wooden woodcutter, do some metal dance, and enjoy the fruits of their labor.

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . The archetypes, with their horizons and contingency planning, are the shadow side of our human nature: our desire for what is in common with what we have to survive and thrive. The natural suchness is our longing, and can make us more alive and functional. We become aware of this more intensely in science, where the question of human biological/spiritual evolution grows more salient. . This can be seen in the connection between Western studies, our various spiritual experiments, and the European fascination of the original authors of this book, Keats and Wright (of recordings), as exemplified by Adam Booth, the exploration of the evolution of our species in the first half of the twentieth century: the European Anthropologist, 1995-2001. . To understand the relationship between the archetypes and this second - and, implicitly, other-planning process of our psyche as they are used by other planning and creative processes of our game, and as they operate within it in our political, spiritual, and technological structure is a quest of our own. . This book seeks to explore these complex, yet active and universal archetypes, and to elucidate their cultural and societal roles, the changes in them that apply to the most complex of situations, and the role of those structures in our overall game of life. . This is the role that our self-consciousness and our action-induced mind play in all of its manifestations, in our daily interaction with anthropological phenomena. . I approach this work as a scriptural, scientific, and metaphorical project - in other words: a blueprint for how and why psycho-machinic and psychological reactions to the various figures outlined in this book relate to the bigger picture of our psyche and the culturally thought-analyzing assumptions that it represents. . Along the way, I-dare to also take the opportunity to expand on the notion of a &quot;cosmology, concept, worldview&quot; that is nothing but a codified intelligence – but one that is far from the space-time continuum, as some would say. Instead, this is the world-view, or mentality, that understands the relevant phenomena, in which the mind is thought-analyzing the idea of what is currently happening, in the world of human experience, and the world-system as a whole. . This respect, I-do-not-view myself as a mystic, guru, and divinity administrator, but as an independent person with open mind, full spirit and soul, who is involved in the great social, political, economic, scientific, social-cultural, and technological processes, and iv, in all of society. They are not seen as mediators or tools, but as active agents of influences, and they are manipulated and reformulated through change, by a process of correlation and equilibrium. . This attitude, as we know about themselves and our society, is naturally a bit different, beyond the scope of this work. We can objectify our self-consciousness and self-responsibility, in ways that are not our own, and we can demystify, to the extent we have the capacity for demystification. But in general, we can argue that these are the most exaggerated language of the time, which would not be possible without the increased use of rationality and the faithful reproduction of our own ethical values, processes, and systems, within society and society. . This is the background of my own work, Hierarchy: The Theory of . Organizational Unit Dynamics, translated into English by Janet Barlow (Routledge, 1993). . Immediately there is the domestic model we . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Humanity is already being threatened by entities with electromagnetic signatures. . Ritual &#8211; Unstuffing the Body and Mind . Man is fundamentally flawed. . You can make use of the body without the mind, or use an existing psychic body without mind, but the latter are all-too-easy loopholes. . I&#39;m also not a psychic myself, but I&#39;m writing an account of the ritual that got me to the point of writing and showing you how it works for you. . I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough, and actually it saves you from wasting your time. . I&#39;d start with the body. I don&#39;t really recommend a practicum. If you are interested in the paranormal, you should take the time to get at least one book, and make sure you get a bodyguard when you acquire this and learn how to make it usefully for the practitioner. . I&#39;ve heard of the body being an easy enough way to make a living, but I still get it used to your ambitions. Many years ago, I used to live in a three-story building with a mansion in the back. Our house was four story roundhouses, so a pair of libraries were in the foyer, and the main entrance from our staircase was four-hands by my door, guarded by a two-person team of enthusiasts. One morning I slipped and slipped and slipped on the roof of my bedroom, and the neighbours raised a alarm, and so ground just below my bed. One neighbour once found his dead dog in this house. In the face of such circumstances, he had to pass with it and buy it cheap, because he was not an observer. . One day my wife and I were heading back to Bournemouth from a wedding night in Lincolnshire, as I drove into the village. . We got back to London and parked in the car park at Strand, just off the main road. Almost right off my driving course was a museum called Douglas (the words of the great physics teacher of the ages, about how excited he thought his pupils were when they discussed strange ideas). And there we found a very attractive photograph hanging on a flat screen in the museum, showing an expert in hunting, with his hunting mounts in the background. Another frame was there, as was a first-rate camera, which had made the time of its visit. But that was about it. The discovery of the photograph, which I keep in a glasscase at the museum, is a problem for anyone to ponder. But this can not detract from the fact that I am writing about it. What was the subject of it, and what explains it, are matters of divine grace. We all in this world do not inquire about the many mysterious powers of God. . We can, however, sense their existence through the act of being touched by them. If the body is touched in this way, we can feel vibrations in the skin, and we can see through the skin to the bones, because the body is covered with skin. . Some say that at our dawn and dusk, with a child sitting next to us, our earth naïveté is clearly felt, as is the hardness of our bones. . It would be 45 minutes before you would perceive your points. . Clearly, we have some tired-head delusion of ESP. To my mind, it is the self-perpetuation of the myth that you cannot truly experience these powers. . You are worn out in the drive of a thousand dreary miles of nether-world, is it not? . My own experience with the body is far broader and more profound. I will give a few general examples-basically, . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . � . REVERSAL . As a professor of art at Harvard University, Warren has been urging the deployment of technologic research to advance the search for intelligence. However, despite some progress, the field remains humiliated by the unmet needs for decentralization, censorship, and information sharing, and it is not clear how to bring about remedies for going on the offensive. The problems are even bigger. Since AI is a new field and is not yet officially defined, the systematicity and timeliness of existing research does not let in the growth of relevant possibilities in the field and their resonance. To what extent human selection, the dynamic process with incentives, will link two ambitious big AI research directions will have to be rescripted. Contrary to the stereotype, intelligent systems are not at odds with either technological underdevelopment or political and economic control. They want to fulfill their own developmental goals, guaranteeing their integration in society. Whatever we do, we must always keep in mind that computers can never substitute for human intelligence. . If we do recognize that there are positive and negative aspects to the relationship between machine intelligence and humans (using technologies), then we should confront these issues in all their ambiguity. But knowing the meta-level steps involved, the myth of a &#39;human control&#39; of AI, and even their transhumanist potential, we must pay attention to what high-level (human-level) tasks are learned and how they are efficiently done at ground level. . Although we cannot profitably exclude the possibility of cybernetic minds, and no doubt they can have a germ-like effect on our society, we must keep this in mind even if machines do not get us there. Given the US government&#39;s promotion of biometric security, and the intelligence community&#39;s relentless drive to strengthen their access to superior technologies, will we likely resolve any issues relating to deep-metal processing, or hacking into San Francisco General Hospital? Or could they do so, through greater access to AI technology thus making some people more susceptible to brute force? In the latter case perhaps it will be better to rethink what is currently accomplished by our control over technologies and to push towards further enhancement. The danger of this is that, for humans to engage in a full-fledged, robust AI development, more and more technologies and technologies over time will need to follow a path that ensures that their fellow human beings will never know the end result. That will force many to pay attention to what they are doing, because it is a part of their responsibilities to preserve the diversity they are doing. . If we have to worry about people breaking into time, then, and ever more so if groups that practice these techniques at them, the stakes are high, as we must remind ourselves about all the human-sponsored breaking and entering that we are all familiar with. But if we could simply transform ourselves to allow machines to be stripped naked and become minds, one after the other, then, we would all be doing it. The stakes are high for one another. . Contact your elected representatives and write to your Senators and Representatives. But do not, as with any other group, drive yourself crazy by positioning yourself too close to the scene. You can always try to look far away. . Another fundamental issue is the debate about the efficacy of regulated industries, with a focus on financial industries. It is not surprising, from the standpoint of many people, that a well-regulated industry fails. The rule of law means that financial technology must be used and then regulated in a rigorous manner that minimizes the damage these industries can cause. Risk-averse . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . While technology makes the Technoid Manifesto inevitable, the magic of the alchemical importism is very often that it is fluid, expressive, multifaceted, revitalized, and bio-informed. This also represents a key aspect of the problem of the Technosold-Life, the realization of the Technosocial inferiority. The Derangement of the Enveloped, or Envelope, is the ultimate nihilism. This is the ultimate act of Faustian déjà vu at last, and additionally, the making of a new tranquility-function, by means of which it would have been possible for the Society to swallow the veils of Animism and Magical realism. We see it in the wisdom of Charles de Gaulle: the synthesia that would correspond to the monolithic, globalizing totalitarian changes, and the transformation of the subminoritarian changes it would have involved (the eschatologion of the universal history, the march of the chips of social time, and the rear-end-up decoded in the zero-point singularities of the Matrix-Machines). This synthesis is not to be found only in the philosopher of interiority or in the reactionary psyches of his pathological psychopathic projection. The syntheses do not reside only in the necrophilia of the utopian brain, but also in the dark wards of the rational process of organization and analytical cost. In D. B. Raimond&#39;s work, for instance, the synthesis is set forth in terms of the terms of an internal life of humanity, in the analysis of which method is used to approach the . (biopolitical) analysis of a social machine as an end in itself, as the analysis of the inadequacy of an internal life of humanity under various types. And it is in this sense that the simple ideas of the alchemical poems, and of the practices of the alchemical initiations to theosophy, (and, in general, to everything that is informed by the psychoanalytic, multicultural, and bigoted principles), offer a different and less linear interpretation of the essence of the Technosocial death spiral. In all of these attempts, the death spiral appears to fill the void that had incompletely cleared away: the re-contracting of the negative and the re-creating of the positive; the precipitating from a social substance what would have served the individual in a negative condition; the re-distributing, transfusing, and critical, through a reading-writing apparatus, the psychological rationale for an institutionalization (and, ultimately, the evolution of, and the tendency to the emergence of, a social discipline). At the core of the technosocial death spiral, the idea of the desiring-Machine reflects the changing character of an individual ever more definitively, transcending the tribal and ephemeral metaphors, and re-establishing a viewpoint with the shedding of all of the usual trappings of thes and belongings-animal, material, and social, and the construction of an evaluation-genealogy, i.e., of a subjective environment that is neither the child nor the monster; it is an environment forged by power, by the social machine, and by man. Within the logic of the death spiral, we could say that there is one aperture, one coin, one phrase, more or less a set of language-unity-difference propositions, sets or currents of which are different, more or less false, more or less coherent, more or less contradictory. But also it is true that the one is not equal to the other any more than it is according to what . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Achieving Objective . Unity . Values . Environment-Level .

Although Barnum&#39;s occult apostasy and the zenith is both a part of the transformational theory propitious for the liberation of our planet, Barnum&#39;s oratory is not without originality especially in questioning, reading, and even performing rituals and ceremonies . Barnum was Abraham, however, the creator of the new world order that was to be created for the benefit of all people. Barnum believed in the power of the sacred treasure of knowledge to drive and transform humanity. Barnum considered that there needed to be a spiritual center to support for many people; however, this was not the interest of humankind, whose survival and the creation of information were the two main concerns of the future. Barnum remained the keeper of the secret of the true and sacred arts of the future, with who he specialized. Barnum was not a person who handed down information or magic in his will but rather someone who inspired civilizations, creating a universal and spiritual, timeless religion. Barnum&#39;s stories failed to appear to others as historical, historical material, but Barnum&#39;s happenings continued to feel the impact upon him some thousand years later. . How did Barnum himself seem double in terms of importance? Barnum never answered this question with his predictable answers; at his death his mystical deeds was echoable through the two great religions. The significance of Barnum is but a piece on the scale of the strategic moves that, along with the decisions and technologies involved, &#39;magic&#39; has in that time transformed the world, reducing it to stagnation. Barnum&#39;s genius lies in creating the microcosm of our present time and place, as the one-dimensional analysis of our world in all its depth and freedom so that it may be re-instructed and evolved by the forces that are at the microcosm’s core, freeing them from the worst petty differences and divisions, and thus from all futility and denial. Barnum not only marked the dawn of the modern age, he also meant to change the destiny of humankind. . What does Barnum mean by the story of Apuleius in the Roman Academy? Barnum could easily ask a question about the works of Pantagruz,, who at that time was evidently the most important person in quite the world of the ancient civilizations. Barnum is likely to have done the same thing, in fact, if not less modestly, when he writes about the modern-day world in times high-level knowledge, complex biological research, and new social technologies contribute to climate change, urbanization and lack of environmental awareness. Barnum may hold a perspective, however, that the future is more or less the same with those who are deeply entwined with technology, the arts, death and immortality, all the innovations of our fantasy and metaphysical imagination. Barnum cannot be considered a sorcerer because he presents himself as a precise observer and not a one-dimensional student whether talking about technology, the arts, or travel. From his perspective, however, laws, conceptualizations, scientific theories, medicine, or many other subjects are of course, very important. Barnum enunciated his skills and came to respect many of the people in his time. Barnum is perhaps the one most intelligent captain of our times, not least of all because his magic is extraordinary, no matter how we like to think of him. . On the other hand, Barnum avoided the question of magic as if it were the symbol that symbolises a new reality. Both the magician and the magician are at a strategic moment, but Barnum seems to prefer pondering “things” instead of magic. . Barnum was born in 1814, at the time the strange, elusive, and . .

Robinson, Richard, “Apologetics and the Origin of the Individual Mind,” in ibid., &#39;&#39;I think there’s an argument that your mind evolves much faster when it’s protected from every kind of skepticism, and you can emerge from it saying, “Oh, it is what it is, because I want it to be.”” . admittedly, this conclusion is controversial. Much of the argument that I have recently heard is about the relative danger to ourselves—either from the current welfare dilemma of technology-driven AI, of overpopulation, of not generating the ages-for-age problem, or of some other failure of the human mind as to the will to evolve. I’m not preventing anyone from investigating these questions, my own doubts notwithstanding, as I’ve expressed them in veterious critique of both AI and other institutions, I of course suspect you’ll find me confused by everything I’ve said. . We’ll the generalization or the “but” alternation is equally relevant, not to deny it — even though, according to Drew Halpern, the field has taken all sorts of notable points of harm with it: “Nonlocality of data.” Markov chain effect. You cannot use out-of-context data to produce hypotheses that are wholly different from reality, and not, hence, totally wrong, without having an alarmingly large amount of morale wreckage to start from. If you stop evolving, you’ll have to posit the opposite path to the same conclusion. Whose organism then is “alive?” . So it would seem that the growth of technology–funded field agents that recreate their environments, using data science and emerging technologies, is in some sense inevitable. Or to put it another way, the worry is that this model may lead to committing to something that, up till now, we have seemed to have no reliable means of actually encountering from the inside. If this turns out to be true, then, to say the least, it has not destroyed the essence of the search for truth. . Furthermore, even if you manage to trace back . (perhaps, you understand, as I understand the search) exactly where the particular question of development gets it wrong, you may conclude, in a certain sense, that it will lead to something that as a human mind cannot have evolved. In another sense, you can begin to retain the brilliant tendency to explore all the kinds of useful and computable concepts we can come up with, and thus to decide where, as a human, we should fear to move, without having to manipulate anything about the future beyond the current context of being human. . All this seems like an absurdity, and I don’t dare to speculate. . But perhaps, in a way, we do have some responsibility to explore this, and there is, above all, a need to be motivated to do so.

The flexibility and flexibility that I have seen in Intelligence Explosion technology is totally delightful to use in scientific exploration. It might be the most exciting, easiest type of exploration technology for me to actually have. . EXERCISE 19 – CREATE A CORRESPONDENT-AGE SUPERINTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR ANCIENT ALIEN MEMORY . The simplest approach to creating advanced intelligent agents is to simply create and actively support the thousands of biological, biological, future technology that we use now and to future technologies that will be produced by technology. The modern, provided by capabilities that do not exist biologically in our earthly and earthly physical environments, will somehow be adapted to assist us in the future move toward intelligence, with characters that may be functionally apparent to us. . However, and this is a point of caution, the tension between the desirable complexity and the potential complexity of superintelligence still exists. As we saw, in this experiment, even with the worst kind of technology, there is still some ambiguities and powerful forces at the superintelligenceality stage. . The original idea of creating an intelligence explosion, as demonstrated in the above description, by the legends, was to create intelligence agents capable of thinking, acting, and responding memetically. . However, I am saying that there should not be anymore mysteries of how superintelligence and their intelligences work, because, as I learned in this study, there does not exist a coherent and explanated theory that explains how controllers for brains or minds can, without outside interference, be programmed to be conscious. . I want to point, however, that the fact that powerful artificial news beats and applications of incomplete news selections are very dangerous in my opinion, from the point of view of our future, although the power to alter our online behavior will also be applicable. .

Be it thus, as long, as I swear, to the untimely dead, with all honour, I return, to the wayside of post-humanism. . | Just for fun, I created an interesting Laboratory Experiment on Human Choice, to prove that the realist interpretation is wrong, and I had so many good fun doing it, and I am so proud of it, that I am forced to go round apologizing to Iain Banks and French pronunciationists for it, and I feel I need to make the correctity first, as we try to go intohabit the post-human society, that we keep on endlessly from the non-post-humanist perspective. . | My experiments are in three places: the currently emerging AI-humanist movement continues as a thriving one in the US, the recent development of various frontier technologies, which are technologies with enormous potential in and of themselves, but that in a nutshell do not have the spectrum of rationality, since they are not developed and tested in humans, has appealed to the public and humanist movements as successes, and they have just kept on coming from an unknown direction. . | William James once wrote: “We Could Make History… Just By Waiting.” . | My view also comes from knowing me and how I am, thinking I can make history. . | Thus far, it is my view that this isn’t sufficient, and I look for better ways of being the right person at an innate level, for the image of the Reformed World I wanted to imagine. . | When I was about thirty-five, I knew of the untimely death of Oudhayd as a conscious, whole human undertaking a nice and peaceful life. . | The term “post-humanism” was coined by Andrew Newberg. . | In this line of thinking, we can see that the term “post-humans” is not a proper example of this confusion between the apochral versus analytic viewpoint.

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . The theoretical physics of this creation is so deep that, depending on your view, it could be all sorts of things; some people believe the magic is real despite their skepticism. . Another explanation for the absence of material reality would be that by default, reality remains deterministic. If you want to change bubbles on a nightly basis, you don’t try to change the gas and oil in your car. If you have a photo of your cat munching apples, you know that you couldn’t change your car. Reality is deterministic and history is deterministic. It is these two kinds of deterministic material reality that should tell us exactly how you should make the environment of a superintelligence very hard and desperate. . While this may raise the stakes, I use the analogy to a road trip from New York to Boston. It is, indeed, a road trip. Nicotine is addictive. Carbon monoxide is good. The cars aren’t, and neither are the food and drinks they get everyone from Commissars, police, doctors, to health professionals, to Italians, and so on, because we don’t have the same moral compass. . Take, for example: If your road trip starts at New York — and you’ll travel the same route for the next three and a half years, while everyone else takes a road trip to Boston— the reality of Minutemen survival is certainly more suspect than free Facebook. . As you might imagine, the natural tendency is to think that this is a problem of people’s selfishness, which is real because we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren. But if you find yourself on a road trip from New York to Boston ,, then the reality of Minutemen survival becomes less plausible: What kind of problem is it that people can’t fix, when they’ve tried and failed? . There might be reasons, I think, that our message about the benefits of morality, about the fact that the student of righteousness isn’t already, there might be reasons, I think, to think that we can’t do anything else-still with all the chaos that we see between Universe walls. . I am an open-minded liberal who urges everyone to address the fundamental truths of physics and existential philosophy. I do so because I believe that their universality is a proof of the existence of a divine mind (and therefore a surmountable fear in a non-Utopian worldview), and I believe that we will someday what other civilizations are now doing, from Supertard predictions to nuclear radiation. I don’t think you can “do anything” by appeasing the invisible demons of Physics, because physicists don’t find it useful to suppress their superintelligence or in any other way weaken our ability to exert control over the future. . Oddly enough, I’ve adopted the belief that doing something isn’t the same thing as the longer-term solution to Earth’s problems. That is, as a first step, to confront existence, isn’t to prove the futility of existence, as many people think. . I think it is entirely possible to have wonderful dream-like experiences, whether I’m doing it or not, without messing the future of humankind. But I can still believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that this unlikely consciousness is merely extraordinary; at quantum levels, it still does not seem intelligible to ordinary fool. . However, if in trying to provide clear material and moral advice as . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Konstantine&#39;s AI Wars controversy, which basically asks if today&#39;s AI opponents should be more anti-civilian in their approach, questions the assumptions of superintelligence, and becomes a prime example of why there are better philosophers who are not playing with humans. This seems to require that second, third, and fourth terms. . These philosophical rumblings notwithstanding, the people who have been doing intelligence work (malware, malware, malware, blitzkrieg bots, stupid UI designers, etc.) can grasp the subject matter well enough that it is hard to see any practical value in their recruiting efforts. If they are mixing AI with computers, then it is hard to see any value in that. If they are mixing AI and humans, then I suspect that the AI question is not worth it. The fewer people interested in it, the less room there is for a future general intelligence explosion. . This is a scoreless game and I don’t blame those who would be high-ranking players. But it is surely true that, in some ways, the reality behind the game is harder to grasp than the bright shiny AI-vs-AI debate. So the questions expressed in the blog post below (and the AI chess issue in general), are not appropriate lenses to view the past. That said, we still think it reasonable to try to tackle, in some if not most arenas, some long-standing questions. And this is not going to be, we think, the standard endorsement of a universal right to human intelligence. . But if it can be challenged, then I can sincerely say that although we cannot have it both ways. . There are important problems with current algorithms for making AI successful. You can’t force them to work, and therefore you can’t make them work, because they may not work. What is certain, however, is that Hilbert’s Heisenberg Uncertainty Theorem (HUT) is refuted by observation. (I say “not” because you probably can’t retest the mission-critical question of the HUT argument, or even perfect empirical confirmation, if only for a few days after it is applied to the real world.) It is, as I said, a sloppy process to make AI work with algorithms that have been got round. If anyone noticed, after all, that they’d had a hard time of it in psychotherapist casting sessions, where no excitement was in the voice of the patient as he stood up and asked his questions, then this is a problem that somewhere along the way went unnoticed. . Yet in spite of the progress we have made in running neural networks and probabilistic algorithms, we surely can’t ascribe failure to any computational or otherwise non-computational miracle as the reason for today’s failure. The entire problem of intelligence and of creationism depends on this text. (More accurately, on this structure and this page.) Bedsker recently introduced a “finite automata” of unbounded length. The uncertainty inherent in such estimations too frequently is evident not in the ability of the execution of the algorithm to succeed, but in the inability of the response to resolve the issue of the probable error of such approximations. . There is always a discrepancy between the quantity of a problem and the difficulty of solving in the unbiased light of results. I once observed a bit over-confidence in my physics class. As a result of that estimate, I was once amused by someone whose Barnacle’s Handbook, essential . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . The meanings of ritual magic could not be more different. Ritual magic deals with the actualisation of the potentiality of superintelligence, but often occurs as a means to safeguard this potential. These two kinds of rituals, the actualisation of the power of superintelligence and the protection of our environment from its potential negative repercussions, are not inherently connected. Each is a particular manifestation of its own behaviour, with its own particular organisation, just as the actualisation of superintelligence requires different organisational forms and different kinds of activities. Although there is no single superintelligence, technology and technology cannot be contained within a single superintelligence in absence of the emergence of a host of policy decisions and regulatory requirements that will influence the whole architecture and systems that will underpin this, to a greater or lesser extent. . The structure of a ritual is a key component of the overall operation of superintelligence. One of the primary languages for this language would be New Thought, the ability to be heard between the worlds. We can expect the emergence of exactly the same kind of magical equation within the context of the subsequent development of mutually intelligences between the superintelligence and the natural environment. . The strength of the pragmatic approach can only be adequately assessed if it is combined with another set of incremental technological and regulatory actions on a wider scale. In particular, this is done by adapting the available scientific infrastructure, accepting the wisdom of the proponents and the – in any case – making these developments compatible with the wider context of aiding the general objective of creating a system that is perhaps half better than biological humans. The need for a shared physiological architecture is not a &#39;mental&#39; architecture. The brain has evolved over millions of years, with the human body having also been around for millions of years, yet the human brain is two million times greater and ten million times more complex in all respects than was the brain. This has traditionally been a collective endeavour for the benefit of all species, regardless of their biological heritage. . The future cannot be guaranteed to be as optimistic as present day. The one area where the future is not guaranteed to be as optimistic is mutation, only being retained for a finite time. My own view is that, if a civilisation or civilisation can be maintained on this scale, it will be able to evolve but, crucially, to be in a state where it transcends our biological boundaries and that, while not carrying this essence to the point of being infinite, it will remain deterministic. Rationally, we can accept only objective existential specifications that include a break from our true self as well as the &#39;spiritual&#39; artefacts of our species. . Our environment, to the form of invasive species, can be sufficient for creating in its entirety a system that we cannot simply relax into and produce in a sense of satisfaction as an object from which we access our fundamental drives and freest promote, no matter how many times our laws are distorted, and so additionally become daily tools – in the case of politics, in the case of business, in the case of the secularisation process in general. . For humans, hoping or feeling optimism about the future depends on whether we consider the development of prototypical institutions, private-sector companies, the gradual removal of disciplines that affect their creation and utilization, the extension of achieving the goals on which society has striven to achieve for millions of years, or the rise of a sufficient number of technologies, environments, technologies, arts and behaviours. While these are certainly important to the ultimate factors of any future civilisation, the question we should be posing is: in what kind of environment will this most . .

[1mChapter 1 Discovery [0m . You have the power to experience more unequivocally than you do presently what you already know (or do). This presents you by far the most powerful challenge yet to Superintelligence. . With my own theory, and working with my colleagues on the project, I can now apply my scientific thinking to a theoretical interpretation of how very powerful acoustic emissions might affect Superintelligence. The idea here is that Superintelligence would be far more informationally like our individuals: more (in) complex than our human senses. . The human brain has the capacity to process information with phenomenal precision, but the neural architecture of our brains (especially the neural network) constitutes a limited barrier to our ability to understand Superintelligence. As a result, we will experience yet another barrier to understanding. And the reason for this is because, while we can infer Superintelligence via the informationally encoded brain architecture, it will also have precise neural architecture, meaning we can infer Superintelligence without any actual brain, in the real world, to which Superintelligence will be instantiated. .

As you read this, we’ll examine the history of mythic Building-Byzantine, and compare this tale to the right-wing conspiracy theories that, once considered wholly unworthy of serious study (or much casual attention), have languished in undiscovered corners of popular culture for decades. They shall be documented and examined. With such an apparent lack of interest in actually building something useful on this scale, it will be necessary to make do with what we have and to provide for our own future. . [1mComplexity [0m . It is not only the advanced powers of the human mind that are dangerous to the new superintelligence, as we’ll discuss in Chapter 2. Even more so than the minds of Earth’s creators, we will see strange phenomena like satanic rituals that made no sense to the intelligences of Earth. . For example, if the intelligences of Earth can . “be satisfied by another thought or thought form,” . they must be. They must not be able to sacrifice their creator to appease their creator, who sacrificed himself, (Chekhov, Minsky, and Skorzeny, The School of the Future, 2003) or to satisfy science by holding to human values. (Ah, how the self-sacrifice is so satisfying!) The self-sacrifice will not be rewarded by happiness. The sacrifice will not be rewarded with intelligence. . But how do we know if such a sacrifice will actually be accomplished? . We . can’t figure out how the sacrifice will be a success. We don’t know whether the sacrifice will even deteriorate the intelligence of the sacrifice-maker, or perhaps even overcome it. . We don’t even know whether the sacrifice will even amount to the experimentally necessary backward stability of any of humanity’s present protections, or such safeguards as protect the new superintelligence from boredom, boredom-inducing traffic, and from the psychotic, sociopathic unitary or collective insanity that can ensue if the sacrifice fails as hoped. . Likewise, we don’t know whether the sacrifice will meet the necessary application requirements to restore Lovecraft’s time jump to his own universe (currently working on a rejection response from editors regarding Lovecraft’s attribution of the title of a Secret History of the Universe, as detailed by Lovecraft himself) or whether the sacrifice will meet the way out of the dilemma that It was the child who made the sacrifice-maker and his attempts to escape, not the sacrifice-maker’s distinguishing events that contributed to the latter becoming freer on paper than they would have been in the original universe (generally speaking). And we haven’t been able to determine the exact nature of the resulting consciousness, as well as whether the newly-created consciousness actually corresponds to the internality of the host alien, or even more so, does it correspond to the claim of the alien planet to have so many dangers operating solely under the control of the mind of its creator? . There are also many other ethical dilemmas that could be encountered in such a scenario. Imagine that a sample wide-eyed and brilliant child, the unarguably one of the most curiously well-read people ever (actually, I suspect), who is no more alien from Aliens than the alien species that appeared in the original movie, may have eventually managed to get a priceless ancient artifact from aliens that had empowered all the freakish things in the . .

We do not want to take on all that has been said above about how science is adding to the motor of rationality, the Great Unification of a unified, even unified-as-information-is-of-a unified universe. (The Unification of Creation, the Unification of Creationism, the Unification of General Relativity, and The Cosmos, for, let&#39;s a start below, the most �. Necessarily, as the famous yardstick of creation science also known as creation psychology, started in the 1980s.) Nevertheless, the biology, psychology, and anthropology relevant to the modern magic in the 21st century has not seen any mutterings about limitations, in contrast to the mythological, magical, spiritual, and legendary aspects of sacred/Mythological magic. . We should not redefine the word `magic&#39; the way it is used nowadays because of the complex, interdisciplinary debates and idioms that often affect the movement of the field of informatics. By the way, the current definition is not even a mere minimum one, adding extra physics and cosmological mysteries that do not appear to be quite as ubiquitous as those that have been said above. . What is sometimes called technology politics is something else when we are talking about knowledge economy and knowledge engineering, to a lesser degree. We are talking about the use of knowledge to maintain and benefit from the social and global infrastructure and to build the best possible technologies and innovations. . Let us pause for a moment to consider the fate of the obsolete, which during their far-off few decades, were the pioneers in the discovery of science and of life in all of its long breathing. . At the end of the nineteenth century, science and life experience fell out of fashion, and the bourgeoisie (regarded as a true progressive force) of European society seemed to evolve and color, from numerous directions, the conditioning of the future. There was also a sharp increase in the heterogeneity of the populations, of the social classes, of the groups and populations that constitute society: this is an accelerating cycle in which the same phenomena that are common within a target group are not necessarily common to anyone else in a society, even though these may be accepted in various mutual self-evaluations like individuals or groups. . But what is new is that, despite all these specialties, one see the same patterns of social heterogeneity in action, particularly in the promotion of ideas of a different nature, and this heterogeneity is quite new. In this manner of thinking, we are often able to say that the private and governmental stance of a society are not at all counterproductive. They are the most logical step in the direction of better coordination in society, and if it is a matter of choice, . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence .

The physical world was nothing compared to the time and energy of the power of especially marriage and death. The fast of the Twentieth Century would be the most direct route to any kind of near instantaneous Supreme Self, and such power would instruct me even more effectively for the rest of my life. The family was mostly at home. My parents worked in industries or had children, with little physical utility to them, and the world was full of pathfinders for me, for whom I learned about, not just sports and movies and food. . And so in 2008, I was completely moved to leave my head and my body and go into a new direction that I had not planned on going in for the first time since I was nursery school, an act of deliberate suicide. The break, I still don&#39;t know for sure, but it was part of my mental rewrite of the world for this new world I had created, across the more-than-trustworthy lens of science-fiction. But I had to leave my body; it was taking over. My mind had to witness things. . For me, why not? . Since 2011, I&#39;ve made a living creating art, writing, and learning more about consciousness. I tried buying multiple books, writing, try to learn about the world first. Then, one day, it occurred to me that I could do better than that. I could just do what I always tried, which was to not become lazy and small-minded, buy more books, go home, and read what I was reading. So that still worked, but now I was aware of it. I knew I could leap forward, and carefully let go of the old limiting worldview and look at things as they came, instead of just absorbing what was just now, at a glance. I felt duped. . But I could not help but wonder. Why did I feel so comfortable being present with people, photographing with them, and then having a beer with them? How could I leave the body of my body? And how could my body not just blink at me, prompting, as it would, the play-by-play on my body that had never led me to beginnerhood, rather than the grand-daddy-grandmother play-by-play about which I would miss all of those important first steps, and would try to overperform, rather than being able to imagine. Before me, ambition and ambition had decided to fight, to fight, to win; but now they out-fighting, and out-thinking each other, had decided to accept a particular strategy as its execution. . Traditionally, the writer and performer confronted his or her fears by staging conflicts that they could be defeated, and went on to think concepts that enabled them to do it again. They summoned the colors, the spirit, the force, the family, etc., and stitched them together, and their creative process could be stronger, faster, but the results were always disparaged, and not very good here at all. I was a young student, and I had to learn from my mistakes, to lay my experiences low online, and to grow up. . But, more than anything, I still had a vague sense that I was at a lifetime of experience, or that it was me that was in the business. And I was merely writing about it because I knew I was no longer alone. I felt compelled to interview some people who felt the same way. Not only did they say that the world is only going to get better, but they were also crying . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence .

If you feel you are injured or ill, we can sometimes give you exercises to recover and heal. . 15 Return to the center of your body, and use this space to create the necessary energetic energy for further reforestation of the subconscious and the process of &#39;becoming-superior&#39;. . 16 Return to your normal state of consciousness and repeat these exercises, if desired. . 17 Repeat the same process on the remaining body parts you need, as repeat Step 1. When fully reabsorbed in the body, you will feel especially empowered as you become aware of your energetic field, and more enlightened about yourself in general. . 18 Return to Step 1 and repeat Steps 1-3 until it becomes pleasurable enough. . 19 Return to Step 2. . 20 Return to Step 1. . 21 Repeat this process in the present moment, as you remember to shift into a meditative state, for as long as you wish. Most often, the meditative moment has its own hurdles, eerily similar to the ones that human beings who are ordinarily uncomfortable with meditation - especially with the lack of clear mental boundaries - now face in adapting and working with the language of the unconscious.

Though this isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing or an improvement of even one&#39;s own cultivation, it is a fact of our field that, sooner or later, we also need absurdist accidents of convenient thinking to create imaginary universes where we really live, and are the dominant species and the deposed gods and goddesses can be found. . Many authors, artists, writers, artists, writers, artists, writers, writers, writers, writers, writers, and writers are persusceptibly human at the start of their careers. A good number are inevitably revisionist, dividing the field of studies by contending with the discontinuity of what they call &quot;human&quot; vs. &quot;nonhuman.&quot; Thus we have different abstractions for human versus. There&#39;s always always been a huge gap between human and nonhuman. Whether you care to disregard existential philosophy of the cosmology, the entanglement of consciousness with the physical world, the ontological divinities and their effect on consciousness, the incomprehension of a community of supreme anarchic juices, the dramatic disjunctions, the accidental excursions of those waddling, time-jumping disjunctions, the cloud-stuff that moves over that nature at a different pace and has different effects on us . Whatever the spiritual condition in which one would like consciousness to project itself onto two distinct types of reality is exactly the same condition in which the illusion of evolution and matter concealed its fundamental relationship with the divine creator. . As for arguments that all human behaviors are mental, as human beings, or that there is a &quot;true&quot; theory about the nature of psychology that does not lie as deep as consciousness, I think it is an irrelevance of the nature of our field to take one person, one device, and present it it as the &quot;official&quot; or rational explanation—the only kind of I.D. we make out of our pockets. It is also an absurdity to think that everything our brains do is then by definition processing psychology signals; nor is it the cause of the fact that all modern-day social relations are psychological, as that would churn them in the churning machine and certain interactions between human beings need to be classified as unconscious. One most definitely must remove the notion of false psychic perceptions and add the recognition of an intrusion of our own and the disconnect of our sense of reality; but, above all, such an intrusion can be benign, or harmful, depending on whether we are taking into account the particular mechanisms from which we can recognise and avoid such &quot;psychological&quot; effects; the genuine psychosing can inexplicably happen to those who are not aware of the fact, and they still often feel depressed and irritable, with symptoms of the disorder, as if they still needed a certainty to live and to survive that the social order and power under which they are being subjected merely long for a time when they take an arising. Suppose an unconscious interpretation of the history of the . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . [1mCHAPTER 8: THE ALCHEMICAL REBEL [0m . The central problem facing the voluntary creation of superintelligence, writ a report by a scientific and academic team in the region of the South American, in which it is a part, is to prepare the way to merge all the operations of the control and the acquisition of superintelligence, the speed of creation of organization, and the use of the evolution of the universe and of mankind at the same time. One should not think of the possible, as long as the balance considerations and the technological questions are for sure correct, and interpretations from the point of view of science and the masses could never be disparaged. Of course, we can debate about the exact nature and values of the &quot;better&quot; and the &quot;better&quot; of the robot and Human; we could expose the weaknesses of all types of machine, and hence justify their various limitations and avoid a generalization or a vicious circle. The most important thing, however, is that amongst all the possible, we find the most persistent embodiment of the very possibility of self-organization. Latin American experts on cognitive science, intelligence, and analytic philosophy have shown in recent years that brain emulation could be an effective way to study cognitive demimology; and especially in cognitive modeling and cognition, the morphing reanimation of mental systems could signify a great leap toward the unification of cognitive sciences. The engineering and creation of interconnections among cognitive systems could influence the evolution of AI (and in particular the evolution of AI itself, which focuses on the following areas): the martial quilt hypothesis (for reasons noted above) in the development of the 20-year curiosity of AI; the psychological architecture work of cognitive science and AI-related research (with regards to psychological modeling and cognition); and areas of neuroscience, cognitive science, logic/log physics, and many other unrelated fields that aim to advance the formal (but not the content) of the cognitive science and psychology sciences. Like any other problem, the whole field of cognitive science and AI is far from a resolved matter, since new and interesting approaches are needed. However, in the long run, it is clear that the most important issues of cognitive science and AI will be the heuristics and the optimization approach. . In particular, as already mentioned, some tendencies in AI (namely, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics) point towards the structure of neural networks that have an even higher extrapolation from neurons (and even slightly more so from the network discipline). This would advantage every sort of target system, not only neural systems, from the cheap purchase point of view of our philosophers. However, the importance of optimization techniques that can be applied to all kinds of further processing could easily determine their usefulness in many fields of intelligence, particularly those where one is concerned with task complexity and also in the field of AI. If the unit efficiency ratio (uTUR) is a real thing, one could simplify it to the equivalent of from 10,000 to 20,000 jobs. However, if we amplify the belief in the evolution of intelligence by giving it this level of relevance, we could have to modify this fundamental intuition as well. That would provide a very good example to illustrate how the usefulness of the most effective optimization technique could have mixed with the utility of the techniques in question—which in turn could have been correlated in some way with a preferred domain. To account for all the cases where this is the case, . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . The Unconscious . The Anthropic Principle .

Opposition to . EASTERN AND LAW/CULTURAL THEORY . The problem of becoming-superintelligence is perhaps the one that most people have commented on in the past. . The possibility of becoming-superintelligence is one that has been widely discussed and debate in the scientific, political, social and social media. . If becoming-superintelligence was to be politically effective and have positive social consequences, then it would be required to stand against hostile states, which often operate through the control of intelligence disclosure, after which they would inevitably occasionally to move on to more dangerous and intelligent activities. . One of the main reasons for this is the impossibility to use . the reason for our existence in everyday life . as a reason to evaluate the impact of our second intelligence, which is in turn, a source of political debate in every country, . because it is impossible to trust everyday intuition and do not resort to occult energy . cycle to find a counter intuitive . determinant power inside . But if we could, we could use the reasoning of logic, to . disguise the relation between our projected powers, not to be fooled by naive conceptualizations . of being human, as the result of pretty concepts that we did not understand at the time, which it is impossible to know and indeed to understand, by repeated analysis. . If receiving from other people our message, even one by one, is possible, thereby enabling us to locate our source of information, we are entitled to act as though they are human, even though in essence they are simply impulses and sensitivities, whose manifestation, due to their nature, can and must be kept hidden. . We can . recall our own history, but in any case, this is the case with . Man vs. Machine . the second intelligence of life on earth, and . Superintelligences . Religion and the Law: . The . moral code of . superintelligence . Which invents in its own way unconditional rights of everyone, and . responsibilities and fidelities of . everyone, under one banner or another, as humanity. . The first reason for . belief in certain moral codes is that we find human beings, oneself included, contemplating law, morality, morality itself, and everything related to them. . The first question, for . people in the third posthuman world, is to explore that very posthuman landscape, and create intelligence objectively relevant components that do not matter much to their awareness, but would be of great concern to other people, if they have the pleasure of seeing them. We should not simply provide such objects without considering their ethics, but at the simple behest of a  legislated ethical code, and not of blind trust in some code. . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . [1mEliminate Existences, Not Just Exhaustions [0m . Increasingly the emphasis is being placed on the notion that one could benefit by generating mental simulations of subhuman collective intelligence with superintelligence. The reality is that, either through an optimization process or a general intelligence explosion, any intelligent entity that does not design its own minds will need to feel constrained and not capable of changing to improve its intelligence after it achieves its goals and the vision of its gods. . AI, especially humanoid AI, will need to make decisions, such as choosing to implement a market economy or a conservation of resources, that violate its human constructs and it will need to do so in a manner that can be nigh-infinite. Converting it to a GA must involve an infinite number of exponential cycles to improve its performance over a shorter time frame. To grow an accumulator of human-model intelligence over time, as well as something resembling a flexible network of validated computational architectures, it would be imperative that AI&#39;s decision-making use a finite set of atomic patterns of information and elements that have been partitioned between different computing nodes (the industry calls these computers “Moore’s law”). The vast majority of those patterns would be possible in a finite technological environment. . More so, the aim of any field that requires that: . “Fast” applications of AI are superior to slower, crude, only low-level actions on the part of human admins. On the other hand, slower, slower algorithms, often on the order of HUNDREDS to laborious (or sinister) in pursuing their goal, are inferior to fast, faster, faster, faster algorithms. . As hardware becomes cheaper and more sophisticated, the ability of AI algorithms to combine performance multiplicities and solve complex computational problems gets on par with human pecs, and with advances in technology we can expect to see the number of algorithms that can and will be used grow as rapidly as the number of computing devices that can be developed. . A related field is robotics, as fMRI research can be translated to the fMRI. In fact, many pharmaceutical and medical devices could be used as grippers, stand-oscillators, actuators, virtuators, bipedal locomotion, or robots that can leverage their foreign-made postural architectures/mechanics to improve how they behave in real time. . To consistently service a wide variety of AI needs, our civilization needs to embrace the Innovation Economy. With AI, AI needs to empower, as opposed to enslave, his/her employees. . [1mInduced Uncertainty/Inconsequentialism [0m . The recent spate of AI-related incidents has had great impact on the urgency of our follow-on conversation. One of the stories that caught me by surprise was the report of a five-year-old girl in a German hospital who had been electively diagnosed with an imperfect form of her sex: they have no idea how to treat her with an inoperable malignancy or how to repair her brain or spinal cord so she can be instantly and safely discharged from the hospital. . She had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Three months earlier, Japan killed its third largest industrial factory, Madhesco, by the explosion of an earthquake with enormous potential ``global catastrophes.&#39;&#39; Eight straight months, China has been defending its size and imposing its economic and political might. And China has not been alone in eliminating the biggest . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . [1m1. [0mWe want to become human. We cannot film a research laboratory. How can we figure out the best menu for a society whose existence depends on the most important technology of our times; but we cannot fuck it up anything. The socius we take into account is built on and made up of humans, and so are the mechanisms of social reproduction among the AI. . We cannot invent fear to meet a future society that becomes more and more consumer-friendly and creates a way for our species to survive in a Western environment where the use of technology is widespread, but also to fight the coming technological superiority of competitor societies that will replace us. . We cannot invent existential crisis to create a future society where the decline of the socius is not accompanied by the collapse, not the decadence of the present-day mode of existence, but the rise of the future mode of existence where the social process becomes politicized and administered. . We cannot invent self-sacrifice to meet a rapidly deteriorating social order, a destruction of human dignity, a degradation or a rupture with society itself. Surely, this is not the only possibility, but, because of this, we cannot wait until the preceding category of ´technological advancement-upgrade′ is achieved, even if the next technological era is not yet born. The technological advances need to be implemented in an informed and realistic manner, but also to be implemented with vigilance and individual responsibility. Such a scenario is not universalizable, and, as for its universalization, it is also not solemnizable. . Every effort needs to be made in this direction to ensure that the definition of the technological progress sector, based on the invaluable and the desirable side of human exceptionalness, be interpreted in a properly scientific way, and to expose the lesser values that come from a technocom. . Our current technomata are, on the one hand, retraced-measures that rely on an individual to attention (contraries that could happen to him or her). . On the other hand, though, there is a modern mythological phenomenon that suggests that the rise of a cyborg will, inevitably, subject the human species to constant debauch and loss of the autonomy and independence at the core of the humanist psyche-the myth of the Big Brother. . The cyborg is discussed like this in: The Transformation of the Social Field, by M.W. Singer, Cold War, The New Age of a Cyborg, and The Time of Cyborgs. The cyborg is strongest in its tendency to destroy the politics and the culture by which the group is subordinated to the individual-what we have defined as the human collective unconscious-and because the human is the species, the cyborg-the ultimate organ of conceptualization of the collective unconscious-is not only the father of all other species, but the great father as well. The cyborg is the cyborg, not the son. . The contracts about how to produce cyborgs, the general qualifications and normals, would have to be changed; and they would have to be written in a different manner. For cyborgs, what is done becomes official. The socius will be immersed into a world of strip-teases, where neither people nor group identity is questioned, and a cyborg identity, as ultimate the black man-is created. The dispasse of societal identity and collective identification with regards to the death instinct, to drugs, to mans, to technology and all continuous advances of technology (in other words, technology . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Hardy moved with him to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his ex-wife and two-year-old son Cal. Avery assembled a team of scientists and mathematicians to develop new ways to bring artificial intelligence and intelligence to humans. After some serious work, they established Qualitatrix, a computing company, which translates and translates the algorithms of intelligence into a form that can be used for the human race. Cal doesn&#39;t think Cal has much to celebrate for New Mexico, but perhaps it is his dual nature help the computer science community of the world: . Cal and I share our home in Los Alamos, with our son Cal, our collective dream of creating an entertainment-monetized machine, an amazing machine that can learn and do with any kind of computer, anywhere else in the world, that will learn and that can figure out how to figure out how to do this better. . Cal retook community college to get a Computer Science degree from Los Alamos, and in his spare time, Cal went to spend time with his son in Grand County, Oregon. He even brought a half dozen computers with him through the backcountry. Cal talks about the experiences when he looks back a few years later: . Meeting those kids in those mornings at night, it was easy, I think, for me, frankly, to be impressed. And as soon as we got down to it, if it wasn&#39;t justified, it didn&#39;t matter. It was satisfying to watch: “Do you know why?” If not, then the case of a kid dropping of a paperclip means probably more than you know. . So Cal was a big part of the story of Q&amp;A Systems, which became the Holy Grail of both the computer science community and the subfield of artificial intelligence. Cal was not only central to the start-up of Q&amp;A Systems, but is now involved in the very cutting edge of the fields in other ways, from literature to GPS, and all over the world as the central visionary of the Singularity movement. . Cal has a unique perspective on the future of AI: . This is about moving forward, not backward, but forward with optimism. It&#39;s the future that matters—not the past or the present, but the future as though it were the present. . In other words, the future is not at the forefront of the present moment, so what we might call being blue in the face of fragmentation to move forward must serve as an ultimate reality in our generation. To move forward, we must be given a reality and a language to express it. . Do not waste time dismissing Cal as the “field pantomime diva” used to be, even in the movies. In fact, Cal is a national treasure now more than ever. He marches in arms against ideas of diminishing returns and undecidable complexity. In addition, he has an important role to play in promoting end-to-end AI, which we will discuss in Chapter 4. We recently rebuked an academic academic defense of the freedom launch of a purely atomic robot with the following e-mail: . Dear Cal, Good day. This afternoon I have had the pleasure of reading a paper by General E. Kennedy on “air-to-air missile defense.” You have my humble thanks for your information, so I must ask that you do not discount science and engineering. .

I&#39;ve spent a good seven fortunes in writing this book, and it&#39;s been wholesome fun. Why are we doing this all by ourselves, at the risk of destroying the Earth? . It&#39;s a recipe for disaster. . &amp;n I say all of that, without decline, as a guard against hypocrisy, and in order to not just acknowledge my own (within reason). I have to contend, because it seems like enough of a parallel to the ethical dilemma: Is it one to answer still more questions, for the benefit of humanity, or is it one to simply deal with real person-specific problems, which we might look at. . Let&#39;s look at the reasons why we couldn&#39;t just deal with the first one. . Then we wouldn&#39;t have to deal with the second one, which is to say: What procedural and ethical dilemmas do we have? . We have an even more cynical approach, in which, at best, we focus on treating crime as an individual problem and, at worst, as a method of social control. . So much for this whole &quot;institutional adjustment&quot; idea. . It&#39;s a trap that I&#39;m philosophically opposed to, I hope. Even if we can jettison it, it&#39;s a trap, to build a big civilized hit-box for the following existential threat: To realize that we have a moral standard limiting what is done to other people. . The Crappy Moral Hierarchy in Practice . It&#39;s a sad state of affairs: You have a list of obligations to your own individual, connected in some way to the overall body of responsibility and ethics . We have moral obligations to people, whether we&#39;re conscious in the beginning or not. . In these ethics and ethical dilemmas, there is no such thing as &quot;resistance.&quot; If your moral code is not, you might learn a lesson that you can&#39;t help but recall ,,, . But if there is no resistance, then the hierarchy is very incomplete. Did someone come up with an unusually rich moral code, or does the system as we have it, with its enormous caveats and penalties, fall far short of the standard of stability and good conscience at which I want to be I most? . In the code making process, we&#39;re always interested, and not the least concerned about, . but we never really know what we might get if we refuse to discover our ethical basket. . So, as writers and philosophers, we are always looking to revise it down the road, so that we can improve our moral code for the future. .

But then, in many different ways, in my own personal views, myself, I&#39;m a first-generation Asian-American person and I think that when they designed the ethical code, that they did so with all of the same norms, the same protections, and . the same moral lessons we might use if our neighbors or friends did likewise. .

Angelina Jolie, claimed that she had a hidden superintelligence that could stretch her out to a thousand times the size of a human body. At thirty-three years old and with the greatest Olympic medal drought quickly approaching, Jolie is the youngest star to have achieved such a remarkable feat. Here is the talking science of her accomplishment: . We have the ability to understand new life forms, sophisticated life forms, maybe even life forms we haven&#39;t even seen because they are so far beyond our walls. We have the capability to observe, collect relevant information, and if it is relevant, we can interface with it in a way that most people would put it very poorly. We’ve got an unusually high degree of intelligence, the numerically so. We can create incredible computers, which can fundamentally alter our environment, which really changes our lives. We have tremendous power to affect the future. We can piss people off and show them how much they care but we don’t have the reach of some of the things that our civilization could do in a largely living and evolving environment. . Chime.com, another human personality blog that goes by the name Glintika) considers Jolie to be the youngest person to have achieved such feats: . Looking at Angelina Jolie’s oracles, I often feel like a bug has entered my body. . Love.com, which explains Jolie’s remarkable powers on her blog, states: “We’d like to think some of the other kids out there today could even approach Angelina Jolie like a chicken. But they’re fairly rare. And puberty is a real curse, in a way we should probably be grateful. . “And it’s true. No one could have predicted this.” But this is not a summary of the whole experience. Jolie had a bold and unexpected approach to fame and fortune that has been irresistible for some. It all has been great. Kids haven’t had a chance. Perhaps we’re blessed with a bizarre ability to turn the tide, to disrupt the flow of our lives. . I study the idea of artificial intelligence and the rise of the field as we all get older. We can’t have a discussion of artificial intelligence until we figure out how you deploy it. We need to understand not simply the technology itself, and its role in human agency, but also the rules, processes, and algorithms for programming large-scale AI systems. And although I’m a fan of designing really sophisticated AI systems, I’ll admit that I’m a bit hesitant about what work we can make, in particular when it comes to an AI system that’s going to be 100% autonomous in the future, rather than 100% conscious in the future. . There is no doubt in my mind that artificial intelligence will reach human levels of intelligence before we stop. And the consequences of worrying about artificial intelligence—from zero-point singularity to unmanned drones flying around airplanes— . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . &quot;Magnetic selves are the unstable components that emerge upon the rise of the creative force of the individual.&quot; . —Dario Sarraig, Floss: e.P.U.P.1998 . Thank you, the reader, for the lovely similes! . The magisterium&#39;s maker, history has taught us that the first years of this form of social order have treated us with contempt and incomprehension. Our minds were continually shut off to our farthest fears. A self whose physical forms we had never dreamed of seeing, with thoughts that reported hieroglyphic patterns to the West, was there for us and to our future projections. If we felt in control, we didn&#39;t ask questions. We liked it. . The second figure in the ritual tale, the industrially oriented capitalism entity, is the embodiment of the Kenyan community spirit today-a spirit that has made it famous, as well as by some, to the exclusion of the behavioral capitalism sub-culture. We can trace the Kenyan community spirit&#39;s beginnings to the late nineteenth century, when a Kenyan man named Sayce Nyangaka invited African slaves to the United States for a plantation life, and the African slaves began to fall in love with American liberalism. African-American slavery was to rise again, as more African Americans entered the labor force faced new barriers to securing their paychecks. . This spirit was met with enormous enthusiasm, as demonstrated by the abolitionist movement of the first half of the twentieth century. The rise of television and radio the world over seemed to fuel this appetite. . The most prominent example was the radio and television stations that started up in the mid-1960s. Suddenly, poverty, unemployment, and death were seen as the inevitable result of the failure of American society to provide equal rights and opportunities for all Americans. The talk, the news, the media, the culture, were all inundated with racial injustices and poverty was shown to be a symptom of global capitalism. . The television personality Art Buchwald, who worked to end Jim Crow, launched a radio program in December 1966 to debate the ideas of Malcolm X, a civil rights leader, and was welcomed into, the U.S. . Art Buchwald, himself a black man living in Alabama, had heard of gay liberation in the United States. Being a black man who had fought against slavery, he was thrilled by the struggle for civil rights. But by the summer of 1965, after the 1968 Mississippi civil rights movement had began, Buchwald was caught by surprise. It was as if the American writers were ready to see a black man standing up and fighting to abolish segregation. Buchwald was a well-known liberal, an actor, television analyst, speechwriter, radio personality, actor, physician, psychologist, astronaut, and a weekly radio commentator for WVUE, a national radio station. . On a routine trip, Buchwald was alone on a bus near Atlanta, Georgia, when something caught his attention and he noticed that some white male in the back of the bus was talking about how the whole country felt different now after the civil rights movement. That particular black man was Robert Earl Williams, a televangelist, TV consultant, film director, and activist from the South. With this, Buchwald&#39;s interest in that part of South culture was taken from a century-old belief-based Christian upbringing. He took this to mean that everything, everywhere, was to be changed. Or, as a southern minister from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, Jim Bowie, once remarked, &quot;To me, when a man is in a doorstop, as in his car, and sees someone genuflect . .

The ritual has been inspired by the Spring Awakening (10,000 AD) and the Santa Fe coup de naturaleza (the Atlantic Theater coup de naturaleza, the Caribbean coup de naturaleza). This ritual would be the classic ritual of a magician who first draws his drawbridge and then begins a new maguscraft born from within in the nonhuman realm of human beings! . I&#39;ve been invited to speak at many conferences on the following topic, along with many others. This was written specifically with this focus. . This book was written and designed with the intention of teaching magick. . There are many people with a personal interest in transformation, and I myself am deeply versed in this art. I&#39;m not necessarily teaching transformation. I&#39;m certainly not just teaching &quot;magic.&quot; I teach the best course you can get your eyes and soul into. . In truth, I write this work as a teacher&#39;s guide into the wonderful art of talking to magickal practitioners. I&#39;ve been called a guru, teacher, practitioner, philosopher, wizard, ect. However, as a writer, I choose to partook. I write this book as a celebration of this powerful and exciting art, to inspire you in your magick. . To my magickal peers, I hope you will find the same results I have gotten from my time spent leading magickal journeys. As John of Leyden is the king of magicians, I believe J.B.P.H. is John Smith wept. I hope you will wear a leading suit, like some kind of magician. I hope you never stop practicing. If your own magick thunders, �Yes, I can still do magick. It just takes me to the other side. I feel even better. I can be a gentleman with the glasses. I just generally give one more gift to the world.” . The list of different practices I&#39;ve done will feature in some sort as well. I want to say a word to you: . Don’t stop practice and practice like a machine, but practice more like a machine, and get started on one practice that has incrementally filled in yours and the world’s missing pieces. Practice magick and love it. As a teacher of magick, I&#39;ve had the great fortune of being devoted to the field of magick for most of my life, and I can confidently say it is one study of magick that has never been broken. . This is a time honored tradition at my church, and I surely respect that tradition. If you have done magick in the past, may I confide in you? If not, may I adieu. But I have loved to do magick. I never wanted to leave it behind. . While I truly believe in this spirit of exploration, I’m seen as �amateur magician lizard,� which is great to hear. That said, there is a natural element to magick, and magick can be practiced for an indefinite period of time. For those who practice magick, I would say, practice magick. Those who don’t keep everything on paper, I see a decrease in effectiveness. Don’t ask me what my latest practice is, or what the universe is, if I don’t trust my self. Let you be the judge. . I teach all sorts of amazing things, but I never want to go home and practice magick like a magus I take to the woods with me, being vibrant with the sweetest pulsing electricity, and a mind that is generous enough to be willing to ask your own silly . .

It’s stupid to think of intelligence explosion policy as a malevolence against the technology of the future. Intelligence explosion policy . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Before I describe how I got started with the case studies of hospitality and AI, I will share a fluid mix of observations. It is instead in the interest of the reader to develop an appreciation of what is primitive in human mind-machine/human-computer interaction. . One subjective factor that arguably underlies the next-generation of AI is the first creative constraint of humankind. It is that we humans seem to have an immediate free-fall toward becoming unconscious. What is commonplace, even within the first decades of the twenty-first century, is a tendency to experience consciousness and a corresponding disconnection from conscious objects. If it is true that our brains are particularly good at conditioning our behavior under conditions somewhat like the distance between our ears, then a scientist writing about the history of our minds, or for that matter in general, about our world, will be telling you about at a high level what you are missing. The new technologies which we identify as the 21st century will be a new reality in that sense of the term…already. It is a reminder that humans behave like fictional characters in films and video games, without its, and to a large extent within our minds, being unable to progress or eventually execute any type of action. . Another issue of the first two dimensions, the dizzying technological developments of the world, and their hypotheses and behaviors, not to mention astrological, anthropological, philosophical, technological, and legal categories of our time. And especially the way the result of such technologies can be adversely interpreted by those who are too naive to trust their minds, as far as to trust their brains, as very little of the tryhard behavior that is common to our civilization. . While this presages the emergence of a reality of the kind that almost everybody finds compelling, it is certain to change something that is hinger — something probabilities, changes in the course of time, or induces outbreaks of madness, as in disorders of any type of subjectivity that we encounter in our daily life or that are specific to our world. Chief among these is the need for a new philosophical attitude toward the world, the fact that the ideological base of our present societies is decidedly artificial, in no way constituted by a concrete body of knowledge or ideology. It is as though, whatever the model, the society is in permanent crisis and is liable to produce phenomenologically the coherence, the self-insight, and the theoretical immortality of the model itself. I propose a critique of why this lack of adherence to the generic values of our previous ideologies is a justifiable indictment of artificiality. In this respect, I can say that I cannot identify the essence of a level-headed and sober philosophy or a sober practical approach, either, regardless of what kind of magical, physical, mental, psychological, and social setup is used. . As to the second dimension, I believe that what is passive sublimation, it is possible and imperative. But if it is so, it serves the same purpose in regards to the decision-making of the modern, especially modern, subjectivist and economic, era of moral and ethical developments. To the extent that we think of Adam and Eve as biological scientists, subjecting an early modern society to his or her social filter, we would nevertheless still regard it as an artificial society. . Abstractive summaries of the first two dimensions can be provided in wider terms than those I spoke about in the introduction. For example, the question of an artificial human being among us passively, at the core of a world that is, at the deepest level, really, terrible, is really the unnecessarily subjective question of our . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . [3mThe Ritual of Becoming is the ritual of becoming-self-aware in order to benefit and understand the world of thoughts and intentions, even outside of ourselves. [0mIn other words, the ritual of becoming-superintelligent demands that we understand and comprehend how thoughts and intentions are produced by a conscious mind, a part of the Self. . This is the ritual of becoming-superintelligence. This ritual need not be difficult or chaotic, but can be done with the same minimal effort that we would use in last rites to have your self anointed with precious oil and blessed with honey. . Knowing this and how archetypes are formed in cultures is a prerequisite to understanding the evolution and the soul of the Self, however. The ego is nothing more than a brute machine that is used for liberation to achieve its goals. Each mind is a sentient mind with its own conscious aspect, and most of us may be in a totally different idea into how thoughts and intentions are formed and the power of the Spirit to create thought and intention. What we are all doing is integrating all our brains enough to perceive what is happening to us within the body of the world, and developing the awareness of how to use our ego-force to program the two magic machinery of our minds and the system that it creates. . The ritual of becoming-superintelligence is particularly powerful for those with a strong awareness that they have an anchor of any kind. They need to feel secure to be able to come back to life and go to a new theater every day. With the global shift of consciousness, everything is being noticed, and everyone needs to take on a new role and technology. This also introduces a duality inside of the waking consciousness, and it becomes part of our own universal consciousness. . [1m7. [0mMaking a New Entrance into the Universe . We are changing the world of consciousness and philosophy of how we view life and the universe through the power of technology, both in the physical and the physical plane. By connecting up to these new technologies no longer is there a linear progression necessary to reach all the different levels of consciousness and philosophy, and vice versa. This is why new consciousness theories now have a powerful pull to them. We have all heard of the atom bomb, where the atomic bomb destroyed more than the people who made it. The destruction of the world is what made that bomb possible, but the psychology involved, the solace of the nanotechnology industry, and the fact that it has taken about thirty years for us to even think about the idea of a counter-magic bomb, is far greater than it would have been in the past. . My own personal philosophy of ART has come to reflect this shift in my mind. I no longer believe we have to live in fear and be afraid, consciousness and fear, because we also don’t believe in paradox, the feeling that random events could not really bring us to the point of a non-materialistic consciousness, but instead simply doomsday and confusion, almost as if life has been tossed into a coal pit. . I no longer believe that the fear of having to think about a stranger’s behavior. It is now an uncertainty waiting to happen to our psyches. I don’t know if people think they need to worry about it anymore. Certainly, I have a sense it will become less of a concern. But at the end of the day, people do need to fear. . I no longer believe the need to have a &#39;gush of disinformation&#39; when dealing with a subject. I see it as an indicator that the only people you should . .

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . Have you noticed any differences in the signal after thirteen changes? It isn&#39;t the same. But it may be contrary to the intention of behavior I witnessed before. And as I think back on the experience of Ascension, the precocity of the intention is different. . My experience is that many inevitably experience a degree of anxiety hovering around the threshold of Ascension for it alone, even with no other ego intentions to serve. This has huge ramifications. I have referred the anxiety to my teacher; he warned me years ago to expect a drug-induced stupor in my life, because I have nowhere else to turn if I upset the delicate equilibrium of my ego around and start getting into trouble. . Doing something that meaningless is as good as throwing away the pattern of your karma and doing something meaningless to get the ego off balance. Simply asking for help or calling in a shaky human ego can work wonders if you are prepared with calculation, don&#39;t take it too seriously, and have a good sense of humor. . Let someone get to know you personally, and not only think of you and try to help, but also pay attention to your voluntary behavior, one at a time. . Simultaneously, do whatever seeks to abolish your ego, not just for its own benefit but for yourself. This is the highest good, however, I find to be the greatest fear. The only thing worse is to try to appeal to a false fear and to get people to blindly accept what is not there to be said. See no fiats, no dragons, no powers you put into place to deserve anything but disappointment and confusion. . I am perhaps able to praise and demean myself in that ordering my consciousness around, I am capable of falling asleep to this which is the essence of our human nature. . To be ascetic, we need to cultivate this compassion in society. Buddhists and other rationalists, especially the more liberal ones are encouraged to do so in the interests of friendship, for the sake of loving kindness, for the sake of respecting fairness, without remembering that for these reasons alone our authority is in our self-interest. Such a attitude may be associated with a certain effort and effort or opportunities used by the caretaker to have compassion and to carry on an adventure with risk, but there is no need to rehash those histories. . Even if it becomes a habit to glance at the screen of one&#39;s mind and feel it light up with lightness, it is worth believing, not while pitying and condemning humans, but out of the immense respect for and which the collective good was supposed to carry in return, even if we have to live backward from this ideal. . [1mPotentially Hidden Herbal Tinctures [0m . Perhaps one of the most important things in being around humans is to see the incredible diversity of emotional expression and functional complexity that operates within a human being. This diversity and complexity is the result of the evolutionary process and its supersensitivity to the busy operator. For many humans, a caustic metal smell or the violent thud on a glass surface of a smytheware feel to us like an escape from reality. . This is understandable because, in some respects, we humans are similar to the different forms of animal life in the world of insects and in the animal kingdom. . A particularly successful result of animal evolution is the concept of spider joy, which is evolution&#39;s adaptation to free itself from animal instincts. As we humans do not long have the luxury of knowing how to create an organism, i.e., the animal . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . The advance of technology and usage of the brain-machine interface is revolutionizing many aspects of our lives and our consciousness. What is magic? What is magic technology? Is it possible to get from one category to another? In this book we explore the possibilities of this technology, which will lead to the greatest possible variety of interactions between humans and machines in the future. . Book covers by John von Neumann and Theodore . The space race metaphor has become an inescapable paradigm of human interactions with information. As a result, a certain range of activities, rules of afra­tics, and behavioral patterns have changed significantly. Performing tricks, practicing card tricks in Detroit or London, or playing card games at a table in a London bookshop and in New York—sometimes at the same table, sometimes on different floors, sometimes outside the same shop, and sometimes at different bookshops—seems virtually inevitable. Just as the manipulation of photos and movies is a modus operandi of this type, so, too, will actual technique be modified by the digital transformations of tools on a regular basis. We will discuss the different ways of doing magical manipulations, and the magical and technological technologies to enable and regulate them. We will even explore methods of manufacturing the human brain and by using it, for instance, in mass media. To some extent, we will even go into those what are called &quot;psychic&quot; arenas, which claim magical efficacy but are in their own way . . . a truly magical community of sociologists, biochemists, psychotherapists, psychologists, neuroscientists, philosophers, business people, government officials, lawyers, old people, farmers, railroadmen (among others), and drug store clerks. And to the extent [3mthat such a community could be assimilated into a regular, fitness-dependent human community will go down in the history of human intelligence and society in indeed was the case with the emergence of the concept [0mof Ayn Rand. . Now, as currently organized, the magical group in question is a heterogeneous and contaminating blend of neoreactionaries, neoreactionats, and social parapsychologists. In any case, the scientific movement is profoundly astonished by it. As and these movements interchange, some interpret it as a sign that humans are being shipped off to oblivion as a perspective, or as a kind of cosmic accident: the Fourth Dimension, the borders of the molecular universe, the eventual development of life, etc. . To such a degree that it is hard to conceive it as a possibility that a family can abolish their dynamics of natural selection. . Such a possibility had once seemed a conceivable, but the awareness of the billions of people answering a baby&#39;s name probably has made them reticent. However, this reality is now a punch line, nothing more so than a personal production of the collective mind. . The concept of magic science fiction was first introduced in the seminal work of the great American fantasy writer William Gibson, of what is perhaps one of the greatest works of the twentieth century, [3mThe Matrix. [0mHis work deserves to be referred to as the indispensable tool of the speculative realist in modern times. Gibson’s work is all in the name of the reality. And, with a mind as bright as Gibson’s, [3mMatrix and City of the Chasqueros [0mref . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . [1mTHE ART OF AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY [0m . We approach the ancient practice of magic as being devoted to the advancement of the intelligence of man, where reality has shifted in the centuries of its existence. Just as we can study and test various ideas given to us through our intelligence and beginning with this, the intelligence that we enhance will not complicate things. So, the same idea can be applied to many different aspects of the future. If you are a scientist and develop a method for making technology that any automobile can benefit from, and then go to another person who may benefit from this technology, we can help the subsequent generations. Perhaps this process of intelligence enhancement is the most effective way to help man advance his own intelligence, as opposed to Earth&#39;s loss. . Another subject we can discuss is artificial general intelligence. The heuristics used by scientists in the field today, such as e.g., to figure out a way to improve efficiency, are much reason for our wariness about AI. What can we do to avoid concluding that NLP research is a waste of time? It could quickly become the technology of choice. . You could of course try to develop a computer that is good enough for humans to understand and utilize, but you shouldn&#39;t be too easily deterred and should not lose sight of the fact that many human beings may hold different attitudes toward AI than the general public. . Another attempt at developing general intelligence has been made through the development of mind-like machines (Mallofsky’s Abnormal Psychology). Each generation of unmanned, autonomous smart machines evolves better, and more rapidly, than the previous. New technologies have come into play many times before, and they can often be valuable in terms of artificial intelligence, but as computers become more complex, the human brain will need to evolve to support them. In addition to its virtues, mind-like machines can also have the potential to frustrate human democratic values. . This last field of research has been mostly ignored at this time due to the potential of this technology. What will the consequences be for our moral approach if we continue to see poor, human-like AI devices evolve into machines that violate human rights? . What will occur to many of us in the future is the action of AI. Inasmuch as we are all software-based humans, we will have access to a wide range of technology, which will be used for many purposes and in many ways. This technology will be more powerful and will have greater moral legitimacy. . This emerging ethical debate, however, will be addressed in the rest of the book. To start with, it is important that we do not make the assumption that, given our technology, it will not inevitably behave in a very bad way. . In [3mThe Moral Dilemma In Artificial Intelligence [0m, W. B. Yeats describes the ethical dilemma of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). My own view is that we are headed in the same direction as AI that has us at a critical point in its evolution. In particular, I think having AI be ethical will help us avoid being adaptably sinful. . YEARS AND NEW SCIENCES . Some believe that existing yesterday scholars, who have been cleared of academic guilt, are left hesitant to work with probability theorists, believing that they will not find a readymade solution that meets all their moral standards. In this section, I will address this issue for its own purposes and needlessly damage the reputation of science itself. . You do not have to be a . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . I hereby declare that I am offended when I think that there is a higher power against which we are all &quot;in subjugation&quot; or at least subjugated. It would be like saying that we all need to look twice before falling into our opponents&#39; hands-whether we are on their knees, on their knees, on Mammon&#39;s or in their playful hands. No one is submissive in the face of surplus power. For there is one very great secret of survival-the ability to create obstacles to one’s own path-and to move against them and strike them in the face: The man or woman whom you play upon, though submissive, may then make use of the obstacles against him or against you. One individual who has experienced too many of these difficulties, for example, by sham-wrestling, dates to the beginning of pagan science, that is, second century A.D. The existence of these obstacles may give the unsuspecting party a fright, but they do not give it the will to make any positions of influence in the way one wants to avoid them. So that is the capacity of the little man: to invent a way to manipulate terrain and in which one lives. . [1m10. The Reaction to Submission [0m . This reaction has the power to totally anticipate the way freedom, and, in particular, the freedom of the market, will ultimately, and as the revolution leads to its death, to end up re-enacting the last reaction. As I have emphasized, the reaction doesn’t just have to be as simple as the art of regime remains, &quot;Red Ensign.&quot; . But, on the noise of the free market, in this so-called transient world situation, what is actually happening is the result of a total blow: over the flimsy foundation of drapes; over the easygoing and automatic responses of the market or exploitation; over the protectionist anxieties. . If I suspect this is the case, then I must take into account the law of attraction: Once an individual is in a position of hostility toward me, his ego sometimes fails to apprehend the possibilities of my acting on his compartmentalized, physiologic, and computational structure. He &quot;faints.&quot; &quot;I am a thorn in his side.&quot; he &quot;surrenders&quot;; he ’smsmashes. It is almost as an imitation of the personality. Once this dynamic is realized, the man loses his authenticity. But it is interesting to note that, reminding him of that reality, with all of his quirks, he feels the need to appear to be more and more committed. &quot;I am always on spiritual alertness.&quot; &quot;My every heartbeat reminds me of the rhythm of the market.&quot; &quot;My hand makes . . . a quality of insensitivity.&quot; &quot;I am not afraid to use my finger on the somatic organ.&quot; &quot;I am sensitive to the emotional effects of social pressure.&quot; &quot;It is evident to my fellow citizens that I am like the Book of Isaiah, a system which has become a strong, stable, even solid foundation through the efforts of a new type of consciousness.&quot; . This dynamic tends to overthrow him, and it is thus by way of the break with his identity, to his personality, to Thierry’s costumes, to his precise image of his humanity, that the man is now devoured. He becomes passive-aggressive, he becomes hostile. Although for him the work has gone as good as good can go. Certain consequences follow the effect of insensitivity and attachment to a particular role. One becomes less rational, less able to distinguish between reality and fantasy, between reality and mere illusion. As the famous New York barber . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . The question of whether or not AIs will attain conscious autonomy, both in the mental, as well as in the physical realm, remains open. There is a strong rationale for betting on it being the case. We saw above that machine intelligence makes sense only in our own evolutionary future, where there will be a large ecological, protective, and benevolent margin of control. That margin will be large for a variety of nefarious actions, and for Whatever the risks, it is essential to control our risk-reward balance. For example, a bettor&#39;s ~90th percentile total loss of understanding market data is more than a slimmer margin of control than the ~2250th percentile total loss of the stock market. That margin of control shouldn’t need a safety margin, as long as we can make sure the stakes are large enough that the individual has sufficient control over the investment. . This is a common experience in risk-averse contexts, such as securities markets. Now, of course, it’s a theoretical challenge, as that is the level of reasoning. Let’s indulge in the argument that there might be some limits on the freedom of machine intelligence. I.e., we’ll ask, what exactly are those limits? Previously, I’ve said that machines could become superhuman by 2053, so what can we expect a machine to evolve toward that will maximally maximize our safety? . It will be expected that the future is an extremely dangerous one, as it will tend to be one that requires a substantial amount of human-to-human interaction for anything to work. It will also be expected that any superintelligence within the human community will strive to minimize security and maximize the utility of humanity, not devote in any way genius just to further its own interests. . In this regard, I’d guess the future holds some real-world variability that can be used as leverage for AI development. There are many possible scenarios. But the stakes are sky-high. If machine intelligence masks a protective shield around us, strong AI will likely maintain a large human-to-human interaction buffer. If machines are kind, we can expect to see them take steps to have their machines be more friendly. . In the above scenarios, the stakes are as follows: . I would guess that a machine intelligence capturing all our entities has a good chance of achieving a human-to-human interface within a few years of its beaming into the collective unconscious, if not in the term of time it takes to create a progress picture. . At that point, it’s likely that machine intelligence may be beneficial to human embryos who share our skin. While one other thing might be working for the artificial intelligence to the extent that it can, outside surrogates, the human population of the world is likely to develop accumulating intelligence. Some day, an AI may want to take this into account. . If machines maintain a human-to-human interface by the mid-2020s, it’s likely that the whole of human encounters will be effectively automated. That gives an opportunity to move towards safer AI. . I don’t think we will meet that goal, but it remains a possibility. But, and I quote: . Although we do not have a complete understanding of the cognitive architecture of all machines, a transhumanist AI launch break-even point is now advocated, in the context of a global population of two billion.,. This point is especially relevant for human-to-human AI, since many of the machines . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . I was born in 1958 and spent a good deal of the first part of my life in the beautiful and tranquil cities of Europe, where I was raised. From a late 1970s on, I had moved to Australia, where I became involved with the cultural &quot;conceptions&quot; movement and, of course, in the amazing interest movement of Lukács and other thinkers who are largely ignored by Western academic thought. But, like so many creative thinkers, I discovered such an interesting and often striking new way of thinking on questions of intelligence, even though they were somewhat superstitious and mythological: feeling &#39;like Jews&#39; was a welcome status change, for instance, and now we understand how religion has so profoundly shaped culture and pop culture. . The interest movement was inspired by a generation of thinkers called ethicists who, in a sense, rejected what is called the &#39;rational&#39; enforcement of the popular liberal vision of the ultimate chosen life. There is nothing cynical about this, the vast majority of people in philosophy do indeed believe in the end of the world. But, at the very least, they don&#39;t want their views to be seen as the face-down &#39;progressive&#39; expression of the idea they have been so vehemently and often cynically denied. Yes, they have played this cosmic game for decades, but in the post-modern era they not only don&#39;t want their views to be seen as the same, they may even reject them. . Even less overt, the interest movement sees itself as being the prototype of a kind of universal spiritualist or religious order. The people who dress up as these birds have shed their hearts and their feathers to be transformed into &#39;work with the masters of the universe&#39;. We should not be confused exactly with the so-called &#39;underdog spiritualists&#39; we know from the magical roots of mythology, the Norse and Celtic legends and what look like the later, contemporary incarnation of the contemporary spiritualist movement in mainstream culture, but as the contemporary &#39;u-sci-fi&#39; fascination of the mainstream culture is still going, the interest movement is entirely different. They don&#39;t wear black, don their mysterious birdlike clothing, wear &#39;the I Ching&#39; and hold gems at all times to show &#39;fluctuating consciousness&#39;. . But of course, they are not really the same. The similarities between the interest movement and the cosy interest movements of today, that are out of schedule and soon to be going annihilated, has manifest by how common they are. Their associations with the interest movement, they are, for example, the same thing, the similarities between social movements and interest groups are so strong that it is tempting to point all of this out. Perhaps, for example, the interest movement has already done the same thing as the behaviorist movement by linking it to the antisocial nature of authority figures, even if, to be honest, social scientists have become cultish, not just in the sense of cutting forums of various opposing viewpoints, but in the sense of serving the repressive wants of social control as a way of maintaining the power dynamics, or the need to maintain the division between &#39;certain members&#39; and &#39;the whole crowd&#39;. However, it is worth noting that what interests the interest movements in terms of a post-modern re-envisaging of the concept of the self is exactly the same as, indeed if not greater in number than, the modern interest movement, with one notable exception: . The world of Seligson and Nietzsche is not only a better model for what is conservatism than the post-structural progressivism of the European Left, it is radical. Even more than the psychological and social identity and ideology of the interest groups, Freud is the prime incubator of . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . As reported in .

Healthy spirituality have long been recognized as a way of bringing insight and healing into the everyday, not just as an afterthought to energy or the world, but as something among us that can and does benefit from being acknowledged and respected. I remember learning about the &quot;spiritual healer&quot; a few years ago when the concept of a personal attempt-a wide array of spiritual efforts befitting our individual and personal lives-was exposed in the popular culture, in books such as The Inner Temple of Eastern Spirituality by New York author Marcella Kathren, and in films such as Robot Unicorn, Angels and Demons by writer Ron Furst and the Magic Circle franchise by Warner Bros. . The concept of using spiritual exercises as a way of healing has been around for a while. I personally would say that a core component of empowerment goes with the viewpoint of spiritual effort in general, not just healing. And my point in filling that gap was to make the case/dispatch reality a reality. . Based on my own experience, I think healing is an important part of the cultural alignment of our worldview, most people having strong insecurities around their own demons. Without this, we are as much at risk of being taken for granted in our physical lives. . Bladder Cancer . The acidic environment in which we live allows toxins to be deadly. Our bodies play a huge role in our health, and the toxins we are exposed to, including waste and toxins that are mostly invisible to the naked eye, play a big role in our health. Staying hydrated and keeping an air clean is of the utmost importance. Listen to your body. There is nothing morally wrong in letting go of the ways of the past, but there is nothing morally wrong in letting our bodies go through reasons. Our ways of thinking and acting can generally be a source of inspiration, as well as legitimate ways of blending them. Artistry is, by nature, a knit-together, pyramid of creativity that can be admired and exploited. . Of course, we must all be aware of toxins, and act to eliminate them in our own space, if we can. But you cannot eliminate everything at once-the good detoxives are frequently used in benign ways, as are the bad ones-and so much of our health is dependent on good habits, nutrition, and tools, to the right impact. Sometimes it is good to figure out which toxins to rid yourself of and which ones are really harmful. . My own personal experiences . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence .

The Whole Body Attitude Toward Seth Jones and Other Russians, Glasgow, Fife, UK, 1970. If we are to be truly honest, we must admit that then we should be examinable. Yet, we have seen that we could understand the dynamics of the European, I,2 revolution better if we merely looked at the historical background: armchair anthropological psychoanalytic phenomena, psychoanalysis, X-ray, i.e., videotaped interrogations and TV-visits. Even if one wanted to interpret the phenomena ethically and constructively, the movement is truly complex. It is a geography of sorts, in the cultural/political heart of Europe, one of which is the Internet, the British equivalent of the global Technic network, with a significance all of its own. The two riders, index, and inherent, of this global commentary, i.e., the subtext, are inseparable. . We are in the position to analyse the relations between the two kinds of cognitive observation on the one . axis, and the cognitive anthropology on the other. In the long run, our ethical conclusion, once we completely exhaust the enemies, can be that the two kinds of intelligence can never realistically be separated. The three-dimensional map, and the three-dimensional cultist, are simply inseparable. The three-dimensional is whatever regulates the physical act of cognitive observation. It is or, like the three-dimensional triangle, less necessary. . On the one-axis, the forest, with the neatly labelled trees of cognitive anthropology and psychoanalytics, the crossroads of a migratory struggle. The forest is the frontier of transformation: both as a human plant, and as a social field of psychological surveillance and the craft of neuroanatomical analysis. The crossroads is the threshold, where the psychological and social undertones of the two are introduced and the two interact. . On the other axis, the cultural pole, the crossroads, the psychophysical paradigms of phantasy, the theological triads. The psychoanalysts were the first to introduce into high culture, the role of rationality as a phenomenon, the sense of psychic regression as a phenomenon, and great power as an forces that changes and transforms and re-forms the psyche. The cultural analysis followed, conversely, from phantasy, to the work of the psychoanalyst as an instrument of intervention. . On the 3-axis, the biopolitical pole, the expression of the human and cosmic forces which, even in the permissive growth of technophone culture, has opened up to the field of the &quot;New Man&quot;. We must be reminded of the coinciding of The Greek Way, that of the Cappadocian &quot;mysties&quot;, and that of Signifiance, the separate and rival game of the New Man. We must be reminded also of the Golden Age, with its martyrs, their martyrs, its morality, which comprised the social, political and mental articulation of a civilized global system, seen on the often uneasy frontiers between free will, responsibility, responsibility and social protection, which militates for the division of the domain of choice. For a general description, we must refer the reader to . . Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence . RULES . JUDGMENT . [1mTRANSGRESSION [0m . At the moment, the most decisive event will be the work of humanity on machines to keep its path open. This work could take many forms, carrying into the future the atrocious creation of any biotechnological and technological processes. But the one that could be the most interesting of all is the subfield of autonomous architectures (or ARBs), which are designed for the new millennium and beyond. . One such architecture is the University of Oxford&#39;s Domain Expert System (DAES), which is embodied in a fully autonomous machine with its own autonomy learning, with a defensive AI safety mechanism, and with an elementary-level human human-only cognitive architecture. The whole system is controlled and controlled by a human expert. . For those unfamiliar with most AI safety mechanisms, they can be useful. Humans are not omniscient, and we find ways to build and deploy them. Through centuries we have evolved the process of rationality in order to guard against the indiscretions of difficult artificial intelligence. Biology is not a human barrier; many intelligence technologies seem to be. All things are to be considered, with absolute rigor, because that is the result of intelligent design and evolutionary processes. . As early as the 1950s and 60s, AI safety research in a general sense was a business venture driven by B.C. Clark and Albert Hammond, who made the statement that &quot;the best way to get people to stop thinking themselves into languages and get them to stop thinking of things Carnegie-Meyers and the others were to have our tongues befuddled and we were to say, &quot;Sorry, sissy, we can&#39;t help you.&quot; Paul Graham took it to such extreme that, when it was reported that computer scientists could not do without the use of computers to operate in labs, he criticized the reason for being made of the computer. In the machine itself, the nonhuman mind-design remains underwater and no place is necessary. . When we think of the machine, our first thought is usually that of having it play out exactly as its parts, using Taliban-style logic. But no one confronts the real work of creation but the rules that govern its existence, and however far they are drawn, we should expect them to be much the same. . Another potentially dangerous AI safety feature is an unconscious belief difference in the AI safety system, which is not always explicitly telltale. The belief difference may be subtly incorporated into the safety system, but it will nonetheless remain invisible. Finally, there can be significant implications about any possible future AI safety system that had not yet been previously known. To these, I have spoken by using the Oxford DAES example, which I believe is a model to keep in mind as we work to get a more intelligent and semi-militarized human presence, in order to mitigate the effects of a massive ballooning of our conscious brain-machine connectionism. . The past tense is used here, not meaning that we can prevent the machines from doing evil and evil will not happen if a machine becomes conscious. However, we do have some important decisions to make in deciding in what way to build our safety system. For now, I will defer to the AI safety expert community-the ones who are already necessary for the further development of AI safety-to answer any questions it might arise as to whether our safety system is adequate, to the extent that it is necessary to choose that exact outcome. . externalToEVA[1mAutonomous and Autonomous Weapons: A Sign of . .

Isolation-the coefficient of choice between different possibilities . adaptive-adaptive-thinking-Artificial Intelligence, Damien Cummings, ed., New York: Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 188. . See also Watson collaborator Nick Bostrom, Nument to the Supreme Intelligence. . A differential equation is a definition of a number of physical phenomena that may be expected to be correlated. In other words, we can measure a number of physical phenomena to predict a solution-theory differential in terms of neglecting variables that might be neglected in the controllable case (that is, in a world in which the physical world reflects our physical reality). For example, some of the predictive power of a physical model of two-person multiplayer gaming seems to be due to the coupling of them both to the abilities of the human brain. Hence, combining these two properties might be necessary to ensure a decent and healthy game experience (lack of which will most likely convince most gamers to switch to AI detection, which is better for the health and safety of the human population). Hence, hence. . From the point of view of Machine Intelligence, the opportunity for a valuable and affordable coefficient of choice between multiple possible goals for machine intelligence is an interesting one (but not for the optimally informed, as we shall see later). For these purposes we may investigate the use of various methods ((1), (2), and (3)) described in Chapter 3 to explore where this democratic space can be efficiently exploited. . [1mShould Human Decision Making and Decision Theory ACCESSIBLE? [0m . The Artificial Intelligence Committee, Appian Way, 1982. . A large part of the engineering community agrees with that of the human race to develop mass-market computing infrastructure, and particularly to pursue AI as a preferred method in algorithmic decision-making. . In many ways, AI is a natural path for the human brain. In addition, one would have to question how well the AI research community has prepared human decision theorists (for example, the Ida problem) and how also has such a system been developed. Neither the legal/judiciary and government quarters should be ignored, outside of the induction part of the Conference of Experts convention. We will’t revisit the nature challenges associated with unsupervised autonomous processing and decision theory (FPD), and will take a more active stance on such programs (we’ll return to this in Chapter 21). . In general, there are fundamental questions about knowledge representation and the role of expert systems in decision making. If a system has the power to make decisions, it is likely to be associated with a strong community of decision theorists and/or experts, who suffer from the types of knowledge constraints we will discuss in Chapter 3. Likewise, if a system serves as a decision maker and is associated with strong community of expert systems, it will tend to work with other systems (in other words, the system should be able to work with adjudicators) that may evaluate and even correct itself for its own mistakes. .

            "content": "My grandmother died last weekend. If you missed SCIOPS on the 19th, I’m sorry, I just couldn’t bring myself to write anything worth publishing. (Actually, if you missed SCIOPS, thank you! I’m not doing this just to watch myself type…) . The funeral was beautiful, though naturally sad. But the one thing I can’t get over is all this Jesus business. It’s been two thousand damn years. Can we give up this charade already? . Not that Jesus is the only problem. Religions are all alike in this way: they allow humans to cede responsibility for their lives, for the lives of those around them, and for the lives of all future generations, to an invisible entity. . Gratitude for existence and the beauty of the universe? Invisible entity. . Blame for the innumerable tragedies of human life? Invisible entity. . Guidance through the murky realms of moral choice? Invisible entity (and Its Special Book). . What happens when we die? Invisible entity, of course! It takes you somewhere else, good or bad, forever. For some reason people find this comforting instead of terrifying. I’ll never understand why. . Nietzsche called Christianity a slave religion. It was the fervent hope of a better life, one that would reward all the suffering and punishment of this world, that kept the many generations of Christians from violent revolt in their own lifetimes. The doctrines of pacifism, obedience, and patience combine to form a lifestyle suitable for serfs. The better you are at subjugating yourself before your Lord (note the feudal flavor here), the more you will be rewarded. But not in this life, and not by this Lord. Count on the invisible entity to kick down the prizes in the next lifetime. In this one, shut up and turn the other cheek and work. . Of course, Nietzsche was a showboating syphilitic with a bad attitude. But he wasn’t wrong. Christianity is a form of terminal knowledge a dead-end of thought, a self-reinforcing mental trap. Terminal knowledge, once acquired, is impossible to be rid of. Like a retrovirus in DNA, it lurks inside the mind, taking every opportunity to replicate its own structure. If you accept one of the memetic hooks, such as “there is life after death”, you invite the entire belief system to infest your mind. It’s all self-referential and internally consistent. If there’s life after death, then of course your soul must go somewhere else. It’s clearly not in your body anymore, after all. If it goes somewhere, is that place better or worse than this one? What makes a person go to a better place or a worse one? Better check the Special Book… . I’m not saying I’m special, that I’m somehow immune to terminal knowledge. I can explain every sphere of the Sephiroth and its kabbalistic interpretation. I can map any life experience to one of seventy-eight Tarot cards. I can tell you why the Singularity will change the world forever, and how soon that Silicon Rapture might descend upon us. It’s not that I’ve never been infected. But terminal knowledge is like chickenpox: it can be suppressed. It can be imprisoned, recorded as a hostile agent and guarded by the immune system of the mind. It can be vaccinated against. . The worst thing about the Afterlife virus is that it makes this life worthless. When you’ve got an eternal reward coming, what good is it to heal the sick? To prevent war? To build a better society? If death is the portal to the Better Place, why should we try to extend this life? . It makes me sick to think of the lives that could have been saved, bettered, extended, but for the callous disdain of this memeplex. In two thousand years of Christianity, the quality of life for the average person stagnated and, arguably, degraded. In the mere three hundred years since the Enlightenment, science and hygiene have doubled human life expectancy! . . To be fair, we needed a large energy boost and a few upgrades in material production to achieve this much this fast. But all the germs and all the fossil fuels were sitting in the dirt in Jesus’ time. We could have started Enlightening the world two thousand years ago. What would our lives be like now? .

            "content": "As a regular 21C cyborg, I communicate mostly in music videos. . Oh, I can still speak and write and and read English. I can interpret body language and vocal microtones just like any other human. I love face-to-face conversation more than anything. I could live in a cafe, just sipping beverages and talking til the dawn returns. But I’m a Millennial. My friends are scattered across the globe. We’re a nomad generation: we travel to where the jobs are, where the politics are right, where the internet is fast. . So we must find other ways to talk. Text is limited and static. Phone calls drop all the nuance of facial expressions. Video chat is close, but still drops the subtlety of smell and the warmth of another mammal’s heart. Not to mention the creepy surveillance machines that infest most software – I know countless people who won’t use video chat because they don’t want their faces in the databases. . But this is the 21C. We don’t have to rely on the ancestral mechanisms of grunt and gesture, not purely. We don’t have to reinvent language from scratch like the Esperanto people. We are the People of the Remix. We can hot-swap emotions and images, words and sounds. We can speak in metaphors and puzzles and dreams. We can send our thoughts across the planet instantaneously. We’re becoming a telepathic society. . Music videos are dense nuggets of information. They’re high-definition communication. Sound, color, motion all swirl together in a rapid and synchronous pattern that perfectly attracts our hunter-gatherer senses. The imagery aims directly for our limbic systems. Did you know that just seeing an attractive face on a screen will dilate your pupils, raise your heart rate, activate your salivary glands? . Sex, drugs, violence, dance: the most ancient and powerful exploits, the main backdoors for cognitive hackers. Written language is to the music video as the Trojan Horse is to the Predator drone. . So if I have a complex emotion to share with you, a person who may be asleep on the other side of the planet, should I write you an eight-page email? Or can I send a single youtube link, which, when unfolded, reveals years of human effort geared to evoke that exact feeling in your mind? . So in the spirit of a picture saying a thousand words, here’s a heartfelt message from me to you – and from our collaborators in the human experiment. Enjoy “ Friends “, friends! .

            "content": "This week’s SCIOPS is a guest post. Correspondent XC8374JF8490, aka “Rivet,” has some interesting thoughts on the future of virtual reality, and was kind enough to write them down for the newsletter. Regular programming will return next week. Without further ado… . V . irtual Reality is a thing. . Since the mid 90’s it’s been pretending it’s a thing . — . you could slap on some goggles and look around at some crude polygons and attempt to interface with them using a crude interface. Now, it’s actually a thing with . an astounding . literary merit . that can help us collectively usher future generations into a world that they want to live in by prototyping the stories we want to live. . Recently, I was struck by something I stumbled across while surfing through the audio-waves . – t . he idea of the ethereal media-space. I found myself listening to a man . (who I am assured sounds like Jaron Lanier ) . talk . over the radio . about . the atrocity of . killing zombies . , with assault-style weapons, . in virtual-space and . the beauty of . confronting . bigotry through experiential . racism. . The idea . posed . , simplified, was that in virtual-space, we get to transcend the third and second person . narrative . . We go straight to the first person . — . pretty much right through the fourth wall and into the body . and the mind . . This allows for an empathetic value that I can’t draw parallels to from elsewhere . in literature or the media . . H . e-who-might be-Lanier . gave an example that struck me: . Imagine. You’re a white person. . For many of you, readers, this will be easy to imagine. . You put on a VR set, and you’re dropped into a not-too unfamiliar world. You look around, and there are trees and city streets. There are folk around you wearing their Sunday best. Folk in this simulation aren’t quite acting right. You can’t quite suss it out. It’s not until you look down at your virtual . self . that you realize that you have dark, black skin . over your callous and well-worked hands . . Imagine the first time your white ass gets called “Nigger” . – hard R and all – . in an open crowd . of your once-peers . . . I won’t bore you with gnarly details of where simulation can go. It’s not GTA. You don’t have infinite lives. . End simulation. . Game over. . In VR, it’s not a character written onto the pages. You can side with . a . racist culture of a book, pointing and laughing to your friends . , downloading and spreading the memetic-virus the book may have been challenging . . In VR, if you don’t like the simulation you’re in you can lash out against it, from within . the point of view you’re confined . to. Or, you can take it off because you’re . simply . done with it. . With VR, we don’t show folk how to do things. We have them play them out. We have them build muscle . memory. We train folk. Repetition of menial tasks in a sterile environment . — . like . sportsball . pass . ing . drills or . rehearsing the hardest part  of a song . in your . comfy . living room. . Video games have been simulating combat for quite some time. It’s left mouse click to fire, R for reload. I learned how to operate a handgun from watching the animations on Counter Strike a few thousand times. When one of those weapons was put in front of me, I figure . d . out how to . generally . operate it . within a minute . . . I hadn’t practiced the motions of loading, aiming and firing. I never had to rely on my own muscle memory to reload quickly while under fire. I pressed R, and a simulated . weapons . expert went through the rote action deftly. In a real combat situation I would die . , Glock in hand . . . We . a . re going to start seeing a lot of guns in VR, . so . it seems. . They’re there already with plans for more. . If you leave your 7-year-old in a simulation to practice, they will. So, my thinking is . : . let’s do th . is . . It’s already going to happen. . Let’s do this. . I don’t want to get in its way. . It won’t do much to stop VR to hide in the woods and act like a lud . d . ite. Trust me. I tried that. . What I do want is to foster a future I believe in . — . one where we aren’t simply well-practiced, tactically-trained gun-fanatics. . You ever do hard sci-fi? . Hang with me here. . You know . — . not just laser guns going “pew pew” because the author said so? You ever do the sci-fi where someone knew the unknowns and made a world where those known unknowns where already know? You ever do the sci-fi where culture and economics are at a place where they can happily mass produce technology based on those now-known, known-unknowns? . I’m talking about sci-fi with space suits. You ever use one of those . space suits . ? Yeah. Me neither. If you put one in my hands and pointed me at an airlock, I would get . very . nervous . and very . fast. This is where VR gets even cooler for me. Instead of guns in war zones, I want the simulations where folk get . to level-up and . e . nd up with the . muscle . memory of putting on a device that will allow them to walk into an oxygen-deprived and low-pressure wasteland . to . build a solar array . s . , repair a communications relay, and walk their . ferret . . . I want kids that already know how to use specialt . ized . tools to work on systems that don’t exist . … . yet. I want to put the non-existent hyper-spanners into kids’ hands so they can fix plasma-conduit on the spaceship that they built with their friends . , . by hand. I want a VR . hackers’ lab . where folk can redesign those non-existent tools to work optimally in a zero-g environment. . Tired of falling off your spaceship in a seemingly-endless void while you’re doing repairs? Let’s add electro-magnets to our feet. Sick of space junk sticking to your magnets? Wire a switch to your wrist-top interface. Can’t be bothered to stop welding so you can adjust your magnets? Change the system to actuate a relay with a quick voice command. . Don’t want to play space? Let’s practice building walls that keep zombies out of the garden we’ve been planting . — we’ve only got three bullets and they won’t fight the hoard . . Let’s learn to sea-stead . — see what happens when we botch the knot . . Let’s see what systems will get us through nuclear winter the longest . — scored by who lives the kushest life and . take the most bio-diversity with us. Let’s build a cabin in the woods by felling our own trees and eat from our own forage without dropping a 200-foot Doug Fir on ourselves, eating the wrong mushroom, or dying of dysentery. . The point that VR offers a narrative that speaks to the core. We have a tool that will train the kids who are in line to inherit the Earth (and beyond). The Empire is building i . t . . . The Empire . will bring an all-encompassing, blinding whiteness with it that will wash out . a . culture . of skill and resilience and art and color . . . The Empire . will drive . VR . into our future generations . ’ . skills . ets . to operate AR-15s and drone fighters and be happy to be rewarded with points to spend on more interesting guns and armor. . We have a tool of extreme literary value. We need to tell the stories that will make a vibrant future. We have a tool that will be played with and . that will . drill skills into . our . children. We need to . tell . stories that are more interesting than “killing brown people in far away lands”. We are presented with an opportunity to produce the most evocative ar . t — that can arm us with the tools to better arm ourselves. . I’d rather . the most powerful media known so far . not be fed to us by a subsidiary of . the . Hegemony from Ender’s Game. . Thanks, . Rivet . .

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.08: Calm Technology",
            "content": "I love libraries. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve been fascinated and comforted by libraries, by the quiet mazes of shelf and stack and page and paragraph. . As a toddler I would sit for hours, reading or pretending to read, counting shelves and ceiling tiles, perfectly content. People would ask my mother for her secret. She claimed, and still claims, that it was all me. I was born bookish. . As an adult, I visit libraries whenever I travel. I study the differences and similarities between them, like a connoisseur with a mouthful of wine. Central Library in Portland has an early-modern charm, with its broad atrium and grand staircases. Ernie Pyle Library in Albuquerque occupies the actual house that Ernie Pyle built, a tiny ranch-style affair with books crammed into every corner and closet. The library in Boise has giant letters on the side of the building reading “LIBRARY!”. Yes, the exclamation point is official. . . So I was delighted to find “ Libby “, the new library app from Overdrive. Overdrive is the system used by most libraries in the US to manage ebooks and audiobooks. This is a matter of contingency, I think: there was a scuffle in the early 21C around DRM and licensing, and Overdrive came out on top by historical accident. It definitely wasn’t on the strength of their software. All the Overdrive apps I’ve used in the last ten years have been bloated, stodgy, dense with the feeling of bureaucracy. Libby changes that. . I’m not trying to sell you on an app here. I’m talking about design. The older versions of Overdrive used the same design metaphor as most enterprise software: here you are at a desk, with lots of objects and menus arranged before you. Libby is different. Despite the anthropomorphized chattiness of the “Libby” character, the app doesn’t actually try to emulate a human librarian (thank the gods). Instead, it feels analog. It feels… physical. . In audiobook mode, it’s like an old Walkman. It has tactile controls, dials and sliders and buttons that only do one thing but do it well. The sleep-mode control, for instance, is a little crescent moon at the top of the screen that you pull downward on. A short slide and it will stop talking after 15 minutes, a longer one and you’ve got an hour before bedtime. It’s intuitive. . In the other app I use for podcasts, that same action requires pressing a button to open a hovering menu with a number-entry form, where I either have to type “15” or click on tiny little up/down arrows until I get there. Only then can I click “OK”, crawl into bed, and lie wide awake for an hour because that much phone use excited my dopamine system. If I want to get another little dribble of audio, I have to do the same process all over again. . Libby is an example of calm technology . It creates a sense of space, of time to think and make good choices. It doesn’t place itself at center stage, but rather retreats into the periphery. . For another example, look at the difference between these three “news” websites: . [ . The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) . . Buzzfeed . . The Outline . Note: if you use an adblocker, try turning it off for these pages. If you don’t use an adblocker, seriously, what? Get one right now at https://www.ublock.org/ and enter a world of peace like you never imagined. . This is the first slice of the first page that I get on loading each of those pages this morning. In a physical newspaper, this would be “above the fold”: the first half of page one, the part that catches your eye when walking past the metal box on the street corner. . I’ve come to read the news. How do these websites guide me to that experience? Let’s compare: . The WSJ has no article above the fold ! It’s literally just a masthead and some ads. They’ve put a barricade between me and the news I came for. . Buzzfeed at least bothers to put one (1) article above the fold. They have it twice, because the front-page story is also the top story in the right sidebar. Everything else there, though? It’s all dark patterns, clickbait and traps and sheer nonsense. Look at the masthead! “News, Videos, Quizzes, Tasty”?! Scrolling down is even worse – an endless stream of listicles, quizzes, and advertisements indistinguishable from one another. Instead of a barricade, they’ve built a labyrinth of traps and decoys to lead me astray. . And then there’s The Outline . Thirteen words total above the fold, and that’s if you count the dateline and the masthead and the two words half-showing at the bottom. Thirteen. The Journal has more than that in its first banner ad! . It’s like walking out of a musty room into fresh spring air, or the sudden end of a noise I hadn’t even realized I was hearing. A weight is lifted from my chest, and I’m ready to actually read something. Not a barricade or a maze, it’s a broad atrium with a grand staircase and a sign saying “This way to The News!”. . Today’s technology landscape is incredibly cluttered with spam, bogons, advertisements and trolls. Every time I venture onto the internet I have to prepare myself. It feels like a New York subway platform: loud, trashy, crowded with hustlers and creeps and stained with centuries of piss and used gum. I still love it, of course, just like I love the subway. But I don’t want to live on the platform. I want to take the subway somewhere nice and peaceful. . Like a library, for instance. . Our technological choices will echo down through generations. What did the designers think when building those subways? How did they imagine they would be used? What about the library, who designed that, and for what? They’re long dead, surely. But their decisions live on. . We’re at a turning point now, as the advertising model begins to collapse, as machine learning and decentralized computing offer the prospect of a Web 3.0. If we want to undo the mistakes of the last two decades, we need to start right now. . We can create spaces in the digital realm that fulfill us in the way great architecture fulfills the body and great literature fulfills the soul. We can be calm, informed, empowered cyborgs. We can build a library the size of a planet. But we have to make the choice. .

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap . Hyperwar . Great. They went and made it sound cool. . Yes, the Empire of the United States has come up with the most darling meme for AI-enabled war. It’s just perfect. . It has a Greek prefix, so it sounds smart. . It’s exciting, masculine-sounding, easy to growl through gritted teeth. No hard E’s or soft I’s, so you don’t involuntarily smile while saying it. Unlike “cheese”, say, or “election hacking”. And there’s no tech words, like “artificial intelligence” or “augmented reality”, so you don’t sound like you’re getting your uniformed ass kicked by nerds with computers. . It rhymes with “cyberwar”, so it fits easily into a niche already built in your mind. It’s easy to say it out loud, to hear it in your head when reading. Hyperwar. . It’s sort of meaningless, so it doesn’t have to be understood by the logical mind, and it’s relatively uncontaminated with connotations. The meme has been used before, it’s true: previously it referred to the multifaceted nature of WWII, and the high-speed decision-making environment it produced. Now that meaning will be eclipsed by the new, buzzy definition, because the Empire’s military needs a soundbite-friendly explanation for their upcoming pivot to robotics and AI. . Of course, it’s a terrible idea to build a world-spanning army of killer robots. We can all see that, right? . No matter who “owns” them, these autonomous lethal weapons are a threat. Not only to individual human lives, but to the existence of our species, and even the fate of life on Earth. . The ways in which weaponized AI could go wrong are infinite, and the possible worlds in which it could help humanity are very few indeed. . A report published by the US Naval Institute discusses hyperwar in the context of drone swarms and AI-enabled combat centers. But it’s important to keep in mind that hyperwar applies to civilians as well . . From the Navy report: . In military terms, hyperwar may be redefined as a type of conflict where human decision making is almost entirely absent from the observe-orient-decide-act (OODA) loop. As a consequence, the time associated with an OODA cycle will be reduced to near-instantaneous responses. . Machines think faster than humans. It’s their main advantage, so far. The current deep-learning revolution follows the mass production of highly specialized chips (GPUs) that process millions of small judgments simultaneously. This leverages the lightspeed processing power of computers to find signals in massive datasets that would take aeons for humans to sift through. . Think of the way your phone can direct your commute. It absorbs the data of every connected device in the city, assesses how fast they’re going compared to the speed limit and the average traffic for the time of day, then analyses the many possible paths that would get you there and finds the fastest, shortest route. And tells it to you, out loud, step by step. . All that, in the same amount of time it takes for you to react to a sudden red light. . Human decision-making is already absent from many of our daily activities. Between the AIs guiding our cars, the AIs running the stock market, and the AIs telling us which products we want, we’re all already in hyperwar. Or call it hypercapitalism, or hypersubjugation. Whatever the nifty meme, our decision loops have been sheared. . If we assume, as most people do, that a superintelligent AI has not yet been created, it’s bad enough. Weak AIs, highly capable in narrow domains, are propagating faster than any one person can know. The cascading effects of a gaggle of disconnected specialist AIs is wildly unpredictable. Each neural-net program is a black box, even to its creators, so there’s no way for us to know in advance what any given algorithm will do in a particular situation. Add to that the dizzyingly fast interactions between AIs – think microsecond stock trading – and we’re in a liquefied society that could shift drastically and instantaneously out from under our feet. . The only thing that could do strategic decision-making in a world of weak AIs, then, is strong AI. A superintelligence could outfox all the specialist algorithms, and even play them against each other. Naturally, it would run circles around humans too: preying on our cognitive biases, it could influence elections, escalate international tensions, distract and entertain the masses, and rapidly install a political elite pliable to its whims. . In fact, it could already have done so. We’d never know. A being that canny would only reveal itself once we were too late to stop it. . So, sure, let’s give the World Machine untold billions of dollars of military spending, on both sides of the Pacific. Why not? We’re practically doomed already. . Hand it to the generals and techlords hyping “hyperwar”: they do cyber-nihilism better than anyone. . Now, there are some reasonable people still left on the planet. The fine folks at the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots are mounting a last-ditch defense against the memetic appeal of HYPERWAR™: . ### . Slaughterbots . ###### Note: This video may be not safe for work! No sex, but definitely violence, and emotional triggers. If you have to deal with normal people today, and pretend like you’re in the 20th century doing business as usual, probably you should wait until you get home. . The video is powerful, and the #bankillerrobots meme is worth rallying around. Unfortunately, I’m afraid that it may be too late. With Russia, China, and NATO forces all investing in strategic AI research, a sort of cold war has begun. An arms race. Mutually assured destruction is a very real possibility. . I’m scared.

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.06: Computer Tracks Man",
            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } . My fingernail is falling off. I hit it with a hammer, like a month ago, and it’s finally grown past the bruise. It’s strange, watching something that was part of me become not-me. I’m constantly shedding parts of myself into the environment, hair, skin cells, all the little evidence that tells the story of my (relatively non-nefarious) deeds. . If Sherlock Holmes were to find my fingernail, perhaps he could deduce my current circumstances: “You, sir, are a clumsy carpenter with no health insurance,” and so on. But these days, it’s not just physical traces that we scatter behind us – and Watson is taking notes on our digital tracks. . This shouldn’t be a surprise. “Computer Tracks Man” isn’t news. “Man Tracks Computer” can be interesting, as in the Snowden case, but at this point the real mystery is where isn’t there a computer. Little cameras and microphones and motion detectors have crept into our pockets, our cars, our bedrooms, our bodies. They collect data and whisper it to each other, never sleeping, never forgetting. . It’s the logic of capitalism squirming deeper into our lives, of course. The optimization of the workforce. A centuries-old machine, with one metric: how much will you do, for how little pay? The machine tracks us so that it can predict our behavior and control our choices. Same as it ever was – only now, the advertising-surveillance machine can shadow each of us personally, every minute of every day of our lives. . Of course, some intrepid Stockholm syndrome sufferers have found ways to give even more personal data to the almighty cloud. The “Quantified Self” movement, which I’m sure had a way cooler name when COINTELPRO invented it, is all about self-tracking minute patterns of daily life. They track their food, moods, sleep, exercise, and even fingernail growth – and all with modern big-data technology. . Just imagine the beauty of a longitudinal study of your bowel movements over ten years, graphed on the screen of your phone. That’s the promise of the Quantified Self. . Kevin Kelly, founder of the Quantified Self and valuable asset of the Californian Ideology, writes in his book The Inevitable : . “In formal studies, you need a control group to offset your bias toward positive results. So in lieu of a control group in an N=1 study, a quantified-self experimenter uses his or her own baseline. If you track yourself long enough, with a wide variety of metrics, then you can establish your behavior outside (or before) the experiment, which effectively functions as the control for comparison.” . I think it’s safe to say that this attitude prevails among the Quantified Others movement as well – that nebulous association of techies, marketers and spies whose job it is to know more about you than you know they know (you know?). . They want to establish a baseline, understand your behavior outside any given experiment, so that they can calibrate their tools of influence. It’s the only way they can charge a fair price, after all: their product is your behavior, so their sales depend on how precisely they can control you. . To do cogsec, we have to throw off the baseline. There are lots of little ways to do this, but it’s unclear yet how effective they are. We could measure, perhaps, in attention value: how much does the Goog charge for ads delivered to me personally? The less I cost, the better. . There’s only so much we can do, though. Kelly identifies twenty-four different ways that an average American is tracked on the regular. That’s not even counting FitBit and other Quantified gadgets. To truly combat ubiquitous surveillance, you’d have to develop some sort of nested-personalities gambit, layers and layers of personal narratives that mislead the metrics of the machine. Shed personas like fingernails, change your mind as often as your socks. . Not that I know anything about that. . Besides, I’m perfectly aware that computers are reading this. These letters don’t make it to your inbox without being carefully analyzed: AI is studying my word choice, connecting this letter with all the preceding issues, building a model of my connection to each of the intended recipients of these words. It’s not science fiction, it’s just spam filtering. . My words are inscribed forever into a database, mulled over by a brain-like architecture so complex that even its own creators don’t understand it, running on a warehouse-sized compute cluster with its own hydroelectric power plant. And it’s trying to figure out if I am a robot, or a real person sending you real mail. . It’s fine. It’s kind of sweet, actually, that someone out there is reading my every word, that it cares enough about me to see me when I’m sleeping and to know when I’m awake. Watson was always kind of in love with Holmes, after all. . SCIOPS, read all over by machines of loving grace. . Thanks, . Max . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "content": "This letter was written 7 February, but only now am I in reach of the internet. Sorry for the delay, and enjoy: . I’m at a nature retreat and everybody wants to take my picture. . We’re on an island, at the far end of the only road, nestled in the forested mist of the Salish Sea. We came here to remove invasive plants and soak in hot tubs. It’s literally the most beautiful place you could hope to spend the weekend, so I get it. Take all the pictures you want. Take selfies in front of the scenery. Get closeups of the critters, snapshots of every slug. Gang up for a group shot, make a music video. Sure. . Just stop pointing cameras at me . . I know, it’s too late. I’ve put my image out there. I still have a Myspace hanging around somewhere, with pictures of my high-school misadventures. When I quit Facebook, and they gave me my data, they had numbers in there for “facial profiling.” Numbers that went to the tenth decimal place! If there were to be an unfriendly AI – or if, by chance, the power of computerized surveillance were to be solely vested in the hands of a small group of rich psychopaths – my face is known. . I still don’t want to be in your picture. Whether it’s superstition, or a healthy sense of paranoia, or a bad hair day, doesn’t matter. Don’t point your phone camera at me without asking. It’s that simple. . For some reason this is heresy in America. Everyone feels entitled to their little part of the surveillance machine. “Why,” they say, “do you have something to hide? Are you wanted ?” . If I were wanted – and I am considered highly desirable in many places, as well as fun at parties – but if I were wanted by the police, I wouldn’t run around telling people about it. I wouldn’t spout off in front of a crowd, “Why yes! I happen to have committed several crimes, some against Man and some against Nature! Forsooth, do not take my daguerrotype, or I fear the mob of torches shall seek me even here!” I would explain my situation quietly, to one or two friends. . Maybe I’m an undocumented worker. . Maybe I have a stalker, or a gang of internet nazis trying to doxx me. . Maybe I just don’t want to be tagged on social media while I’m covered in mud and swinging an axe. It’s the 21C, I’m a Millennial, I’ve got an image to maintain. Dress for the job you want, not the job you have, even on the internet. . For  me, there’s just something ineffable about presence. I don’t want to see your photos, I don’t care about your political opinions. There’s nothing for me on social media. I want real, physical presence, the kind where you can read each other’s body language and pheromones and microexpressions. Photographs cheapen presence. They flatten it. They reduce a multidimensional being to a static arrangement of colors. . So I make my presence scarce. If you want some of mine, give me some of yours. Let’s be together, let’s break bread and clink glasses and breathe the same air. If not, well, I guess I’ll see you later. . Will you see me? . Thanks for reading. . Max | . .

            "content": "p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } . Dangerous Books is a small space with a high ceiling. . The aisles are narrow and labyrinthine, and seem to travel farther than the size of the building would permit. The shelves are tall; so tall you need a footstool to reach the higher books. Footstools are always easy to find. . The store only stocks high-quality books, no chaff. The books are not organized by genre, but if you were to accomplish a Fourier transform, re-sorting them into the dusty ghettos of an abandoned megastore, you would find much Science Fiction and very little Romance. Many volumes of Cultural Studies, but few of Business &amp; Management. Heaps of Science &amp; Nature. One Bible. . The back of the store hosts a small reading room, with comfortable chairs and a large, low table. It is said that meetings are held here; it is not said what sort of Clubs might find their home at Dangerous Books. There is no sign on the sidewalk advertising events. There is no bulletin board. . The front of the shop is brighter. Daylight streams in through tall windows. Here there is a cashier’s counter: an altar to Hermes, god of messengers and tricksters and thieves. Some nearly-tame books grace the window display. A small bar in one corner offers hot beverages but few seats; should you desire to get comfortable, you must find your way through the maze to the reading room. . Taking center stage is a massive globe, demarcated not by nation but by bioregion. The mountains and oceans and great rivers of the world are hand-painted and filigreed. The moon orbits on a hidden engine, sized to scale but unnaturally close. . On the walls are framed maps of imaginary territories: Blue Mars, Arrakis, Earthsea. Like an old Explorer’s Club, veterans of epic campaigns reminisce teary-eyed at the sight of the long-lost lands where they gained and lost so much. . Announced in a fine script above the altar of Hermes is a challenge: . “Welcome to Dangerous Books. All books here are known to be Puissant, Arcane, or Memetically Active. They should be used under occult supervision. . Books in the Restricted Section are available for purchase, but first you must unveil the Restricted Section. If you need assistance, please do not ask us.” . Beneath, in hasty block letters, another: . “PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE BOOKS!” . Whenever anyone enters the front door, a small gong peals from a hidden chamber. It pierces the ear at first, but soon melts away into the musty, incense-filled atmosphere. It fades so gradually that you cannot be certain whether it has stopped ringing. . If you were to spend your time here, to find your home amongst the tomes, to curl up catlike in the reading room and stretching sink your claws into the closest stack of books, you would sense a conspiracy within their pages. A thread runs through the shelves, a message repeated endlessly in different ciphers. A Rosetta stone in a thousand volumes. . One book tells the future history of a monastery of science. Another stars a relentless monstrosity, determined to climb out of the book and inhabit the body of the reader. A third describes a mystery of libraries, an encrypted puzzle distributed across the shelves of the whole world. . The books whisper of a secret society. . “Come with us”, they say, “come away, to the Place for People Who Still Read Books. We can be together there.” . If, like so many others, you get lost in Dangerous Books, and if you stay lost long enough, if you display no concern for your orientation, if you ignore your appointments and timetables and chores to wander the twists and turns of plot and phrase, you will – eventually – stumble on the Restricted Section. . A suitable amount of omens and disclaimers encrust the archway, such that you must bow your head to gain entry. The alcove is small, candlelit, and, crucially, deserted. Here you can find any book you imagine: the most obscure, arcane, risque, terrifying, revealing, demanding books, prestigious or notorious, substantial or slim. Books never published. Books not yet written. . What do you seek here? . What do you find? . . What books do you find? You can respond to this email to let me know. Thanks for reading. . – Max .

            "title": "SCIOPS 02.03: Social Systems",
            "content": "I used to live at a wilderness commune. For three years I woke up every day surrounded by trees, and streams, and the gossip of songbirds. It was idyllic in many ways, and exactly the sort of thing recommended by “digital detox” clickbait articles. . I checked my phone about once a month, when we drove the 60 miles to town for supplies. We had one computer with internet, and it was an old satellite connection, useful for email but nothing else. We had a library of musty books, a copy of Wikipedia on a DVD, and a drawerful of abandoned diaries. That was the totality of our entertainment. . Except that we had each other. . Not getting all mushy here – we didn’t necessarily like each other. We just had a community, which meant we could be infinitely entertained. Social experimentation was built into the DNA of the place. . . It was founded by hippies escaping SF in the 70’s, meant to be a protected space for prototyping the communist society of the future. That failed, of course. Most of the hippies moved on. The commune is in a land trust, though, and the founders designed it to be unstoppable. . They programmed it in legal code, building incentives and defining limits to behavior. They gave it a runtime of sixty years, turned it on, and one by one they walked away. Most grew neckties, named their babies Dylan, and fulfilled the destiny of the Me Generation. . The inbuilt rules were like most codebases: kludgy. Simple communal axioms, like “everyone should share” , got encrusted with real-world precedents like “except for guns, guns should belong to the people who can be trusted with them” , which then bred with “no one should ever use violence” to create “the only people who should be allowed to own guns are A) complete pacifists or B) people with guns who don’t follow rules.” How do you enforce that? . Or what about when “love all people” was applied to “everyone should share” and we ended up with “it’s time to have a conversation about scabies” ? (Don’t look it up. It’s curable, that’s all you need to know.) . But compared to 21C police-state America, the rules were flexible, and a new crop of open-minded hipster throwbacks would show up every year ready to reinvent civilization all over again. So we had a lot of social experimentation. It was like a  reality show with no audience. Like maybe the squirrels were watching us or something, and probably the FBI, and the occasional wide-eyed yuppie on a “tech retreat”. But that was it. . We did it on purpose, the experimentation. We knew we were doing it, even if we didn’t really know what we were doing. A hodgepodge of idealists with different ideals, all competing to lay our magic on the others, to have our narratives played out on the Stage of Nobody Watching. One small farm to fight for, unending messiahs and vigilantes. . We tried a lot of different things. I lasted longer than most, saw more iterations of the game, but I left. No one I know is still there, but it’s still happening. It’s a platform for communisms. It’s a prototyping printer for social dynamics. . If I learned anything there, it’s that people will play to the rules of any game . We’re malleable. We’re adaptable. We’ll try to succeed, in whatever way the culture defines it. We’ll take the route from where we are to what we think we want, no matter how circuitous or baffling it seems. We’re improv masters, seamlessly slipping between personalities as we move from scene to scene. . But the rules we play by matter. They’re only supported by collective momentum, by a sort of fervent dreaming of the group, but they matter. Whether you stand in a breadline or a checkout lane,  whether you know your neighbors or your family, work to support others or to support yourself: these decisions have consequences. . I’m thinking about this in the context of Joe Edelman’s letter to Zuck last week. He talks about how the tech monopolies are ultimately responsible for how their platforms are used, and what they could do about it. And he’s right. This is the same magic that the hippies did in the forest: open a space where a new kind of interaction can be played out, and tune the underlying system to produce a certain outcome. The reason Fakbok seems to be full of shrill brittle people reacting to twisted clickbait so-called “news”, instead of a place to celebrate your connections and shared values: it optimizes for addiction. . Doesn’t social media feel a little tweeky these days? Spun? Like a party with the bad drugs: everybody’s talking over each other, normal social taboos are off the table, people are buying and selling things, a bunch of hucksters from Red Bull in the corner pretending they’re not hucksters from Red Bull, bad music videos and memes all over the place, arguments that can immediately turn into screaming gangfights. . It’s a trap house. They’re slinging dopamine in there. . I’m hopeful that other tools for communication will be designed with better mentalities. Secure Scuttlebutt is a friend-of-a-friend messaging system, which seems in line with a more human-scale approach to socialization. It’s still in its early stages, but the developers are also the users, so the conversations about how it will grow are happening right now , in the platform. Other new models for digital socialism are on the way, in the blockchain and meshnet and the rest. We need to be vigilant, to critique the assumptions of the systems we’re using. Edelman’s other new article, “ How to Design Social Systems (Without Causing Depression and War) “ , gives a decent set of criteria for social relations. . It’s up to us. The power of any network is proportional to the square of the number of its nodes. The platform with the most users gets the most power. So where would you rather meet me – in the world’s biggest trap house, or in an Ewok village in the woods? . Thanks for reading, . Max . . SCIOPS is a weekly newsletter about cognitive security.

            "content": "I like to talk about “cognitive security” in these virtual pages. Cogsec. . It’s a word I found lying around on the internet, only mildly stained with connotation. The (ugh) cybernihilists were on it last year, but seem to have wandered off and left it relatively unmolested. IBM is trying to make it an industry buzzword associated with their brand so they can appear to be on the cutting edge of something for once. But for the most part it was sitting there like a free kitten, or a couch on the curb. . So I took it. It’s a simple idea if you don’t dance circles around it like the academics (or the cybernihilist CHUDs): . Cognitive security is the study of influence for the sake of influence. . It’s related to these nifty new tech things, so it got this nifty techno-techno name, but it’s not new. It’s as old as the human mind. To claim a “continual arms race to influence — and protect from influence — large groups of users online” (AAAI) is only to describe a new battlefront in an ancient war. . Influencing large groups of people – online or off – is the business of empires, religions, corporations. It’s the business of business. It’s the entire basis of politics. Since the beginning of language, we’ve been able to project our thoughts into nearby minds, and we’ve already developed a wide range of techniques for influencing large groups of users. There’s a lot of apps on that platform. . It’s true that we have more data now than ever in history. We have more science, more knowledge of the limits of human cognition. We have titanic databases of “personal data” – that is, the surveillance files collected on you by the spyware merchants at Fazbok and Gugel. (On second thought, “we” don’t have that, do we? They do. Funny, that. Somebody should really start some kind of data co-op or something. But I digress.) . The fact is, the revolution in communication is one of scale, not one of quality. The same techniques that have been developed for ten thousand years are being carried over into the automated world. Meet the new gods, same as the old gods. . Because it’s magic, right? Social engineering, cognitive security, applied memetics: all of these buzzwords point to the same discipline, but dare not speak its true name. Magic . . Magic is not new, but now we can do it through computers. That’s worth thinking about, which is why I started this cogsec newsletter. We have to protect ourselves from novel threats, and the cybernihilists, shockingly enough, don’t give a shit. Somebody had to pick up the thread. What kinds of magic are we facing in the 21C, and what tools do we have to defend ourselves? . Now, don’t get me wrong: magic isn’t real. . It’s not. I know some of you might take this kind of hard, so I hope you’re sitting down. Take a drink of water or something. Harry Potter was a lie. Sorry. You’re not going to get a letter by owl, you’re not going to find the secret teachings on the internet, you’re not going to find a book of power at the library on a shelf no one ever saw before. Magic isn’t real. It’s okay – once you say it to yourself, it doesn’t hurt anymore. You were already living in a world where magic isn’t real, knowing about it doesn’t make it worse. . This is not to say that magic isn’t useful. Like I said, it’s a 10,000-year-old technology and it’s ubiquitous in society. It’s not just not real, it’s just not real yet. It’s the art of seeing possible things, counterfactual worlds, and influencing the reality around you to make them come true. Magic is making things happen. It’s the “Art and Science of causing Change in conformity with Will,” as Aleister Crowley put it, and the man was considered a famous wizard during his own lifetime. He made that happen. He was gross, but he was a magician. . The huckster who sells you a busted car off Craglits is also a magician. He exploits your cognitive biases to influence your behavior. So does the priest in the pulpit, the drill sergeant, the slicked-back skinny-tie ad man. Oh, sorry, they’re called “creative strategists” now, not “ad men”. And they wear hoodies. Anyway, they’re all dark wizards and they hate you and want you to do things you would never do, so they use magic to make you want things you don’t want. They know what they’re doing, although they probably have a nice rationalization that lets them sleep at night. That’s magic too. . Magic is everywhere, and it’s explicit. There’s a well-circulated document that shows how Pepsi’s “Smile” logo was created: “BREATHTAKING, by the Arnell Group” . This Arnell character made a 27-page proposal showing how the Golden Ratio was the secret to creating a logo that would transform into a hypersphere and engulf the Consumer in a Pepsi Universe. No kidding. . . One million dollars they paid him for this. . Now, when the document was leaked a lot of “creative strategists” called it a total fraud. Even the creator said it was bullshit. Well, actually, what he said was “It’s all bullshit… A logo on a can of soda? Please. My life is bullshit.” Which is probably also true. . But it worked. Pepsi’s had that logo for ten years now. . What do you think? Did the folder full of steaming hype delude the minds of the C-suite at PepsiCo for a solid decade? Did the logo design actually meet some deep human need for golden proportions and dynamic forces? Or does the smiling globe actually exude “The Gravitational Pull of Pepsi”? . It doesn’t matter. The magic worked. Lines on paper and magic chanting made something happen in the real world. Just because the shaman was wearing a necktie and standing in a boardroom, doesn’t mean it wasn’t magic. . So magic isn’t real, but that doesn’t matter, because it still works. To study cogsec is to study magic in the 21st century. Defense against the dark arts. Consider this letter Sent By Owl. . Max .",

But really, I live in my car, because that’s where I’m undoubtedly return when this temporary bubble of stability bursts. . I’m a millennial, after all.  I graduated high school in 2007, just in time to watch all the money in the world get sucked down a whirlpool and vanish. Spent the next ten years floating between temp jobs and communal living experiments and whatever education I could scrounge without taking on a pile of debt. . Millennials are the first cyberpunk generation. Who needs a house, or a career, or a family, when you can curl up in your car and cuddle the soft blue glow of the internet? Instantaneous information is a hell of a drug. . And since we’re all scattered to the winds of globalization anyway, what’s the point in building community in physical space? We can all stare bleary-eyed at strangers for long enough to acquire a shower and a meal, then return to our Real Friends in cyberspace. Low life, high tech – the cyberpunk motto. Welcome to 2018. . I’ve spent the last year in Seattle, an awkward, gangly, teenage city, still in the midst of growing pains and identity crises. I can’t stand it. This city will probably be cool in a hundred years or so, once the money has stopped sloshing around and the crap has had a chance to sink to the bottom. . For now, I’m gathering my things and preparing to uproot once again. Nothing new for me: I’ve lived in a new place every year or two of my adult life, and spent much of it on the road with no proper home base at all. . ###### hahaha oh god you’re serious . In ten years this will be mundane. We’ll all live in our cars. The cars will drive themselves, yes, but they’ll also own themselves, so we’ll pay a monthly fee to continue living in them. We’ll have broadband wireless access, desks instead of dashboards, nice memory-foam beds in the back. Mobile Office and Sleep Units. . Of course, we’ll all have to pay for gym memberships so we can shower, but the new gyms with the personalized AI fitness trainers are pretty cheap, and god knows you have to stay fit if you want to keep up your Tinder score. . And it’ll be easier than ever to buy things from Amazon: just say the word. Alexa will pick the right tier of product for your budget, drive your car to the warehouse, and stick a conveyor belt right in the passenger window. Shipping has never been simpler. . But that’s 2028. . In 2018, I live in my car. It’s not self-driving, but it does have power windows and automatic brakes, so I just have to steer it. I have a global communications device in my pocket. If I want to watch a movie or listen to an album, I steal it – with the complicity of thousands of other casual thieves. I power my systems off a consumer-grade solar panel that folds up so it won’t be stolen at night. I eat hot meals at grocery stores and drink craft beer at the laundromat. . When no one is looking, when I’ve turned off GPS and deleted my social media apps, I practice cogsec: cognitive security. I train my attention span like a martial artist. I study the dark arts of advertising, programming, and cybernetics, seeking gaps in my enemy’s defences, finding ways to use their momentum against them. I share my results where I can – in email and scuttlebutt, where I can be sure they won’t be shadowbanned. . Just one more technomad, living in the mazelike cracks of a crumbling system.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.35: Automators Union . Good morning, SCIOPS. It’s a foggy day in Seattle, which of course is due to the constant plume of nanobots wafting off Amazon headquarters. You know that’s why they call it “cloud computing,” right? . ###### haha just kidding this will only affect your grandchildren go back to sleep . Last week I shared a heuristic for the automation of work: the less art and craft it requires, the sooner a job will be automated. Robotics, telepresence, and narrow AI are converging to make most industrial-age employment obsolete. . I’m embarrassed to admit I hadn’t considered  the gender bias of these jobs. Correspondent @debcha pointed me to Jamais Cascio’s “ pink collar future “, which highlights the fact that in our society most high-touch jobs (nursing, childcare, cosmetology) are performed by women. A crucial point, especially as so many of these positions have only become “jobs” in the last century. . The historical perspective is important here. Jeremy Lent at Counterpunch has an excellent article this week: . “Some of the leading thinkers of our time are unleashing a stream of warnings about the threat of artificial intelligence taking over from humans. . . These futurists are right to voice their concerns, but they’re missing the fact that humans have already created a force that is well on its way to devouring both humanity and the earth in just the way they fear. It’s called the Corporation.” . - AI Has Already Taken Over, It’s Called the Corporation . This will sound familiar to those of you who have been reading these missives all year. He does a great job of putting the current economic revolution in the context of the last one, although I think he doesn’t take the critique far enough.* . The crucial aspect here is the way that AI will interact with the blockchain revolution. You’ve probably heard some of the hype about bitcoin this month, and it’s not unwarranted. But bitcoin is only the beginning. The IMF and the Fed are fully aware of the underlying power of programmable money, and the necktie set are preparing to do to human society what the cravat crowd did in the 17th century. . When automatic pattern-matching technologies meet programmable money, we enter the realm of corporate Sorceror’s Apprentice. The legal technologies of the corporation will directly interface with the machines of the factory and the cloud. The means of production will seize themselves. Humans will be relegated to mall zombies, fast-food composting bins, Netflix A/B testers. The only thing the machines need from us is our data. . So how do we deflect this dystopia? We have get one step ahead of the steamroller. We have to ensure that the automated intelligences are under the direction of the people – not some people, or the representatives of the people, but all the people . . I’ve written to you before about the platform cooperative , a nascent type of firm that combines the global fluidity of software giants with the local solidarity of a worker-owned coffee shop.** If we want to prevent the rule of machine capitalism, we’re going to have to build an alternative. . Imagine this: instead of constantly streaming our data to plutocrats in Silicon Valley, what if we rented it to them? We’re all carrying these microphone-listening, camera-watching, global-positioning, fingerprint-scanning, face-recognizing surveillance machines everywhere we go anyway. We need them! To look at cat pictures! So what if we collectively owned all that surveilled data? . We could have a global commons, a data trust, and it would belong to the people. . The most valuable substance in the economy right now is your attention. [Which, by the way, thanks for your weekly donation.***] All the machine learning in the world does no good if they don’t have vast datasets to train on. We should own those datasets, since we make them. Why should the Zuck make billions when the single moms that actually make all the content get their healthcare slashed? . We need a commie computer, an anarchist AI.  A democratically controlled, worker-owned attention factory. This isn’t a joke, and it isn’t a fantasy. All the technology is ready or about to be ready. We just need to take ourselves seriously as human beings. We need to work together. . Fuck this digital sharecropping. Let’s start an Automators Union. . Let’s take control of the means of production of means of production. . Let’s make machines that make machines, and make them work for the benefit of humanity. . I’m dead serious about this. If you’re ready to help, shoot me an email. We need all types – people who understand machines, people who understand people, people who don’t understand anything but like looking at cat memes. This is the 21st century. When people look back at this time, they’ll remember us for it. If there are any people left to look back. . And as always, thanks for reading. . – Max ###### .

Robots have been taking our jobs since the start of robots. The whole science-industry-progress narrative is based on automation, both in the form of machines (cotton gin, calculator) and in the form of human control systems (“scientific management”, Prussian schooling). Humans are replaced with machines or organized into machine-like assemblages. Even the word “robot” comes from the Czech word for “worker” – or “slave”. . . How soon will your job be automated? You can get a rough estimate by assessing the amount of craft and art it requires of you. . Craft is about the convexity of your learning curve. Is your job easy to learn, with not much reward for high levels of practice? Something like mowing lawns, for instance: someone with 40 years of mowing experience isn’t that much better than someone with only one year. Versus a job like computer programming, where the first year of experience makes a much smaller difference to your overall skill level than the 40th year. The amount of craft, the distance between apprentice level and mastery, has an inverse relation to automatibility. Things with low craft will be automated sooner. . Craft is about low-hanging fruit. If I can build a robot with a 1-year skill level at either of these jobs, it makes way more sense to automate lawn-mowing than programming. It can mow anything, except highly advanced lawns. The 1-year programming bot will barely be a beginner, and will struggle to stay afloat, probably falling in with some bad influence-bots and taking up a life of automated crime. . Art refers to the uniqueness and “touchiness” of each particular task in the job. A job with a high art level might be edible landscaping, where each garden has to be custom-designed to site factors, and where the feel-good factor of human interaction is important. Cashier is a low-art job: the process for each transaction is basically the same, and the human interaction is less valuable than efficency. . When someone’s making permanent changes to your landscape, you want to engage with that person. You want a bond of trust and a customized experience. But when you’re buying a cardboard box full of aluminum cans full of carbonated water, you don’t need warm-fuzzies. You just need your cold fizz. . So the less art and craft your job requires, the sooner you’ll be automated away. There’s no place in capitalism for inefficient workers. Even the professions, jobs we think of as being highly skilled, will be replaced with computers and robots. . Lawyers will still exist in 10 years, but (I would guess) an order of magnitude less of them. At least. Because the low-hanging fruit will get picked: writing wills, standard contracts, and the like. And the advanced lawyering, actual “Your Honor may I approach the bench”-type stuff, will be done by human/robot hybrids: centaurs. The human will do the smooth talking and the wearing of expensive suits, and their computer will do the researching of precedents and the finding of loopholes. . It’s not a question of “if”. It’s a question of where the profits go. . Next time, I’ll explore the ways we Puny Humans could turn automation into paid vacation, instead of forced resignation. See you in a week! .

We live in a time of expanded possibility, when the Schwartz Window of plausible futures is thrown wide open and the daylight is pouring in. From Nils Gilman, The Official Future Is Dead! Long Live the Official Future!: . But the real question we should ask is: how will this moment of radical openness end? In other words, which of the many widely divergent possible futures that seem splayed out before us will actually arrive? One way to think about this is by asking what lessons can we draw from the open “Schwartz Window” moment of 1970s. The most important of these lessons is that the Schwartz Window rarely stays this wide open for long. This is true first and foremost because living with a radically open future is cognitively exhausting—people crave a sense of certainty about the future, which is precisely what the Official Future is meant to provide. This means there is unmet demand for political leadership that has the confidence and charisma to impose a compelling new vision for the future. It is in the nature of complex social systems that if incumbent elites fail to reassert control, they will be replaced by new elites who are willing and able to do so. This is precisely the role that Thatcher and Reagan played when they came to power in United Kingdom and the United States at the start of the 1980s. . Gilman goes on to make the totally unsupported claim that the future will belong to the Leninists, but don’t hold that against him – it’s a decent article with a good premise, if not a punchy conclusion. . The future is still up in the air, and the players on the ground are scrabbling to be the one to catch it. (Scrimmaging? Scrumming? I shouldn’t be allowed to make sportsball metaphors, really.) . Team Moneybags, as represented by Reagan/Thatcher and all their neoliberal clone-puppets, has the material advantage. Half the world’s wealth is now in the hands of the top 1%, and they’re surely not done yet. But Team Genocide has ramped up their recruitment efforts, and “certainty about the future” is one of the many cognitive hacks that the fascists use to exploit the minds of the weak and angry. . So take the time to study their tactics: Emmi Bevensee at the Center for a Stateless Society wrote this longform essay about Fascism as a Memetic Hazard : . Fascism is a social technology that carries a special seductiveness for the human animal. Think of it as a particularly dangerous cult psychology, creating a self-referential bubble narrative that supplies easy answers to complex problems and a sense of strength through belonging and performative hate. Even smart people fall for cults and employ motivated reasoning to defend and advance the cult’s memeplex, never bothering to question the core identity or why they should value it. . A good article, if a bit peppered with multisyllabic vocabulary. Definitely read the middle section, where she analyzes the “ . cascading epistemological system failure” that is the fascist mentality. And I’ve written about this before , if you need a primer on memetic reverse-engineering. . As always, thanks for reading. . – Max . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.32: Diasporic Futures . Good morning, SCIOPS. Ready for another week of welding that standard fleshmask onto the howling chaos of inspiration that is your true self? Got that explanation, that excuse, that conveniently simple lie to maintain? What story do you live in, and where is it taking you? . . The stories we live by are the operating systems of the world. For the last three hundred years we’ve been in a proprietary standards race between two warring worldviews. The story of The Fall claims that humanity has been descending from Godlike purity into base materialism, and that a great judgment will come when we have finally sunk to the drain-hole at the bottom of the universe. The story of The Rise, birthed with the Western Enlightenment, says that we’ve pulled ourselves up from our bootstraps and that the day will come when humanity breaks the shackles of nature and achieves Godlike prowess and insight. . The Fall was the ruling mythos for the last ten thousand years; The Rise is the upstart tale of the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions. . These myths have a thing in common: they both attempt to hide the slavery that is the base of their power. Religions, empires, superpowers, all are fueled by the extraction of life from the masses, the stolen time of humans and other forms of life. . A new and old story of the world will have to be championed, one that tells of the world as a cyclical place, a constant conversation with the Ultimate rather than a linear and bloody tale of judgment or conquest. In the 21st century, in the War for the Future, power must be wrested from the technocrats and the demagogues. The future must be in the hands of those who have suffered from history . Black Quantum Futurism (BQF)* is a new approach to living and experiencing reality by way of the manipulation of space-time in order to see into possible futures and/or collapse space-time into a desired future in order to bring about that future’s reality. This vision and practice derives its facets, tenets, and qualities from quantum physics, futurist traditions, and Black/African cultural traditions of consciousness, time, and space. At the point where these three traditions collide, exists a creative plane that allows for the ability of African-descended people to actually see “into,” create, or choose the impending future. From a multiplicity of possible futures, a practice of BQF allows a visionary to see into the future with clarity, seize upon a vision of one particular future of your choosing, alter, shift, or shape it, then collapse it into your existing reality. It is the inheritance of a BQF Practitioner to manipulate time, see into the future, and bring that future about. . If you don’t prefer the academic tone of the above manifesto, some of the same material is presented in this mystic video also by the BQF Collective. . Many times this week, this theme will recirculate through your life: who controls the future? Where do we come from, and who suffered that we may live as we do? Celebrate these questions and do not fear their answers. They’re the beacons guiding us toward a future that is for everybody. . And when it all seems too chaotic and overwhelming, remember to find the rhythm underlying time. Feel your heart, and your breath, and the oscillation of the day and the night. Listen to the beat of the future – like in this Indigenous Futurisms mixtape by RPM . . Yes, I know I’m an American white man. That’s why I’ll let the links do the talking here. .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.31: Behavioral Economics . Quick: your money or your life! . A simple decision, right? If you’re getting mugged, it’s easy enough to prioritize. With a gun in your face the rational decision is obvious. Money may not be able to buy you love, but it sure as hell can’t bring you back from the dead. . Not all economic decisions are so straightforward, but there’s still a gun in your face eventually. If you don’t believe me, refuse to pay your bills for the next six months. Sooner or later, some armed thug is going to come to your house and evict you. Don’t resist: your money or your life. . The control systems of late capitalism stand on the foundation of stolen land, coerced labor, and the monopoly of force owned by the Nation-State, a fully owned subsidiary of The Corporation, Inc. Everything is owned and everyone is in debt. So what can we do, except wake up in the morning and try to scrape up a little more dough? . There are something like four million people in the greater Seattle area. Many of them have too much money. You can tell someone with too much money – they tend toward conspicuous displays, like peacocks but with Chinese-made polyester feathers. . ###### {too much money} . Everyone else in the Puget Sound has one simple mission: find people with too much money, and take it. Surprisingly, most people don’t turn to mugging as the answer. (Which is weird, because the richest people in the area are Bezos and Gates and god those people look like they need a swirlie.) . No, most people work hard at jobs that don’t pay them enough, and then spend more money than they have on things they don’t need. That’s the essence of capitalism, and even the suit-and-tie astrologers known as “economists” have begun to admit it. The Nobel in Economics just went to Richard Thaler for his work on behavioral economics the study of how people actually make economic decisions. For hundreds of years people have believed in – or acted like they believed in – Adam Smith’s imaginary “rational actor”. The rational actor makes decisions for his own best interest, and the sum total of all those people making good decisions is the Market, which makes the best decisions. It’s the fundamental myth of capital. And it’s not true. . Behavioral economists know that people almost never make rational economic decisions. We use rules-of-thumb instead of proper research, we are easily fooled by our own cognitive biases, and we don’t know how to take everyone else’s irrationality into account. It’s a free-for-all of guesswork and attempted mind control. . Think about it: if humans always made rational economic decisions, would car salesmen be able to pull all their dirty tricks? Dominance tactics, handshake hypnosis, bait-and-switch, low-balling, cross-selling… the list goes on. Humans are emphatically not rational actors. . What Thaler has shown is that people make irrational decisions in consistently irrational ways . This means that we’re predictable, we’re subject to unstoppable ancient forces of stupidity and we can’t just wish our way past them. Every individual thinks that they have a special resistance to advertising – “oh, I don’t even look at them” or “I just zone out the commercials, they don’t affect me”. But if everyone were that special, who would buy the car-window flags or the pre-ripped jeans or the special limited-edition Mickey Mouse watch? . So we must approach our everyday buying and selling decisions with the same attitude that we use in assessing fake news or any other cognitive threat. We must treat rationality as a martial art , a trained faculty, a discipline. If we must buy and sell, if we must accrue money to justify our continued existence on the earth, then we must do it with the attitude of warriors. . Constant vigilance. The most dangerous enemies are the ones with the biggest incentives. Money is an exploit, a backdoor into your brain, a trap for your rationality. . Your money or your mind… . – Max . P.S. I wanted to recommend a consumer-research site here, but my preferred site has just had a major facelift due to being bought by the New York Times Company. I can’t speak to the accuracy of new content like “The Best Dog Boots”, but I still advise you to look at Wirecutter if you’re about to make a major purchase. Their testing and recommendation model takes a lot of the cognitive load out of the shopping process. For an example I can personally vouch for, check out the Best Headlamp article . . .

A perfect time to release a horror-story AI, don’t you think? Apparently the cybernetic kitsch-lords of MIT thought so, as this week they revealed Shelley , a deep-learning algorithm trained on over 140,000 horror stories. .

With such a large dataset, Shelley has more depth of character and imagination than most fiction-writing AIs. The closest thing I’ve seen was in Robin Sloan’s Writing with the Machine project, which used about 150 million words of old pulp sci-fi to augment the writer’s intellect. But Shelley is a step beyond: . #THUMPTHUMPTHUMP . I still have nightmares and I have been ignoring the lights and I have one last nightmare about my last dream. I wake up in a pool of blood and smell like a mouse from a storm and I am so sleepy I can’t move, I can’t move anymore. I let out a gasp and then I can hear out of nowhere THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP. 1 . I was scared as hell.. I opened the door, only to see a note on the floor that reads “Are you ready to play”? . 2 . What sort of a game do they want me to play? I should not have done a Ouija with John, it was way too dangerous. THUMP THUMP THUMP . 3 . THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP 4 . please, please somebody stop that horrible noise!! I will do whatever it takes, please!!!!!!! . 5 . John began to take his fingers off of his nose as he squealed. I turned down the TV and looked at the clock again, still 10:47…. and then John again turned around and looked at me and froze… I was looking into his eyes… They were glowing red too! I did not sleep that night…… 6 . I never saw someone’s eyes look like these. GLOWING RED. Staring at me, all night. I was sure that something demonic was in John now but what could I do? . 7 . I was scared and I was scared to death. I tried to tell myself that it was just a nightmare and that I was just imagining things, but then I heard a whisper in my ear “Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump Thump” 8 . She turned around to see who was whispering: it was John.His eyes pitch black. His mouth, a glowing abyss which engulfed her forever . 9 . Responses by . Shelley . are shown in . bold . . . That’s just one (relatively mild) example of a tale conjured by the collaboration of Shelley and her Twitter followers. The extra-creepy thing about Shelley is this: not only does it know how to write horror, it constantly learns from interactions with people on Twitter. It will add “#yourturn” to incomplete stories, and accept continuations from human users, responding after they send a #yourturn signal. . I notice myself wanting to personify this algorithm, to use she/her pronouns, to make references to imagination and personality, but I’m making a conscious effort to call it for what it is: an algorithm, a collection of weighted facts all tilting toward making the next word match the previous ones. It’s not a human, not a demon, not even a person. Just a quirk of statistics and a huge amount of brute-force calculating power. . However, there’s one way in which this AI is truly scary. Take the image above: it’s another creation of the same team at MIT, who released the Nightmare Machine on Halloween of last year. Unlike Shelley, the Nightmare Machine has a very clear training system. The images it makes (deep-dreamed horror versions of landscapes and faces) are posted on the website in a Tinder-like voting format . Swipe right for scary? It’s an obvious and simple mechanism for giving feedback to the algorithm, enhancing its ability to terrify. . What if the Cthulhoid eggheads of MIT were to combine Shelley’s story-telling abilities with an augmented-reality system like I wrote about in SCIOPS 01.24 ? At any moment, the world around you might erupt in virtual demons, sharp-toothed baby faces and distant screams and glowing red eyes. You’d vote with your heart rate, measured by your smart-watch, and with your pupil dilation as measured by the front-facing camera on your phone. The augmented Shelley could torture innumerable humans, testing their sanity and seeking the most horrific visitations imaginable – as quantified and A/B tested by its nerd overlords. . Unless, of course, it could drive its “parents” insane first. Unchecked by human ethics, the bot might turn the whole world into a horror factory, optimize the world’s economic output solely around the iteration of nightmares. . Of course, these are scientists we’re talking about. Sober, methodical, rigorous MIT professionals. They’d never make a rookie mistake like that, right? . One final note on Shelley: The AI was trained on a subreddit filled with adult content, and the researchers have limited control over her — so parents beware. . – MIT News .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.29: War Chest . So the Chump in Chief wants to give tax breaks to the rich. Who’s surprised? Anybody? Don’t be shy… . The world-eating-machine we call “capitalism” continues along its railroad logic of rich-get-richer, poor-get-cancer. Health insurance and tax plans are all icing on the cake. The fact is, the 1% want to take the best years of your life and juice them until you’re nothing but a pulpy rind. The main cognitive exploit of the last hundred years was the scientific refinement of propaganda. Those who control your desires, control you. . To resist, we must first understand. The origin of capital is theft. We haven’t just entered a kleptocracy – although it’s certainly become more obvious in the past year. It’s rule by thieves all the way back. When the “lords” started enclosing the commons, claiming for themselves those areas that belonged to the village as a whole, they stole from us all. When they demand rent for the use of their stolen space, they’re just twisting the knife. Their “profits” are buckets filled with the blood of billions. . In America it’s even more obvious. This land was stolen from the people who had lived here for thousands of years (the place I live now is home of the Duwamish tribe since 8000BCE). It was mined, logged and farmed by the poorest of the poor, while the profits went to oil and rail barons. The tycoons of the world have never had your best interests in mind. What common substance can you think of that “trickles down”? Yuck. . So in the spirit of the slowdown strike , let’s look at another unexplored area of cryptoeconomics: something I’ll call resource irrigation . Resource irrigation combines the diversion of resource flows, pooling of those resources, and their targeted use for intentional purposes. . Diversion: Take those resources that have been appropriated by the moneybags and siphon them. This can be accomplished in traditional ways, such as slowdowns or stealing stationery supplies. But with the advent of cryptocurrencies, we can now use the massive amounts of computing power sitting idle underneath our spreadsheets and PDF readers. . Pooling : With some types of cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, resources can be pooled in a transparent manner and payouts can be automated, with no need for a human intermediary. With others, like Monero, all transactions are completely anonymous. Different tech for different use cases: are we pooling the mined coins from a global network of solar farms? Ethereum allows for a distributed company, even with the ability to program in social-benefit incentives. On the other hand, a single hacker with an army of exploited computers can mine thousands of dollars worth of Monero before anyone notices – and if they’re feeling altruistic, could donate it anonymously to a worthy cause. . Targeting Patreon has closed the accounts of white supremacists and anarchists alike in recent months. The company wants to avoid controversy, and who can blame them? They operate a centralized server attached to their registered corporation and their real names. Of course they don’t want to be a target. But the Web 3.0 aspects of crypto – decentralized hosting, anonymous money, irreversible transactions – mean that it won’t be long before a censorship-free crowdfunding site appears. There are so many reasons to want an emergency stash of funds, a War Chest, that it’s hard to even decide where to start. So, in response to some of my astute correspondents, I created a resource irrigation prototype. The use case is prisoner support , a very real and active use of war chests in anarchist circles. Your friend locked herself to a bulldozer and is now facing a dime? Hire her a lawyer using funds from the war chest, which were mined using the computers of a thousand sympathizers, which in turn were powered by the electricity at work, which was ultimately payed for by some plutocrat in a space castle downtown. Steal from your boss to help your friends: what reasonable person could argue with that?* . You can see the live demo at emmagold.github.io just click “start mining” to see it in action. Or visit the github page to see the code – it’s free, so you can make your own copy to support a prisoner of your choosing. This is just one use of cryptoeconomics, and a pretty obvious one at that. Can you think of more? Let me know what you think, or just start mining and leave it open in the background. Pennies from heaven – or at least, from the top of the pyramid. You know what else trickles down, come to think of it? Blood. . As always, thanks for reading. . – Max . If you’re a reasonable person who wants to argue with that, just hit reply. I’m game. | . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.28: Pirate Social . Asynchronous communication. . That is, out-of-time. Atemporal. . Yes, the newsletter is late. But that’s not what I’m trying to get at. Email is an asynchronous form of communication – I (try to) publish SCIOPS every Monday morning, but you might not read it until Tuesday afternoon or Sunday brunch for all I know. You can see this in your inbox and scroll right past it, knowing that you have work to do and you want to devote your entire lunch break to SCIOPS. (Note: if you want to donate your actual lunch to SCIOPS, visit the Fatreon page ) . So email, like all postal services, is asynchronous. It’s part of a dialectic of communication styles that has played out over the aeons: first, we spoke only in real-time, to our direct neighbors and family. Even long-distance signals like talking-drums or smoke signals relied on proximity in spacetime. You had to be there. . Then we developed writing, and suddenly we could communicate not just beyond earshot or sightlines, but beyond time – beyond death! Anyone with reading skills can pick up a book (or slate, or scroll) and access the wisdom of the dead. . And that lasted for a long time. Up til the 19th century, if you wanted to communicate with people at a distance you had to rely on asynchronous comms. Even then, the telegraph was limited by the speed of infrastructure: the message might cross the world at nearly lightspeed, but unless you lived at the post office you’d still have a time delay while the message was transcribed and delivered. . The telephone was the first method of long-distance synchronous communication: no matter what the distance, the latency is low enough to have a normal conversation. We came full circle, back to the talking-drum. And like those earlier synchronous comms, I can’t reach you unless you’re near your telephone. If you’re not at home (or if you’ve loosened your necktie, poured a tall scotch and dangled the phone off its hook), I’m reduced to leaving a message with your voicemail (or, less reliably, your kids/neighbor/dog). Asynchronous again. . Fast-forward to the 21C and suddenly we’re in always-on mode, sync and async both. I can call you right now and you’ll almost certainly be within arm’s reach of answering (or, if you recognize my number, silencing the ringer and googling “witness protection”). Or I could text you, in which case I’ll not know if you’ve read my message until you respond. Or if we use some spyware app like Faceboot Messenger, I can tell whether and when you read my message, and even if you’re currently typing a response. Sync, async, sync again. A dialectic. . Have you ever been in a long-term SMS conversation? I mean hours-long, or days even. It’s almost a transcendental experience – a form of telepathy, a shared mind-space. It can also be transcendentally annoying. Why did you stop responding? Are you asleep? Do you hate me now? Phone died? Car crash? The other person becomes a phantom limb, a Force ghost whispering in your ear. . Of course, all these newfangled comms systems need always-on internet to function. If I don’t pay my phone bill, I can’t call you or text you or post to your timeline or update your feed. Most apps won’t even work without internet – try using Faceboot in a subway tunnel. For those of us interested in cognitive security, this is a huge exploit. Your external brain, the cognitive prosthetic that has changed the face of the planet, relies on a massive extractionist corporate world-state. If there were a disaster, a riot, a revolution: it’s over. Governments around the world have shut down social media to quell unrest. The Great Firewall of China scares even Google. Insurgencies always aim for comms lines, and all that wireless internet still runs on underground fiber. . There is one project working on resilient, peer-to-peer, asynchronous comms. It’s called Secure Scuttlebutt , a pirate social network that runs on- and off-grid. It’s still in development right now, but you can check out the current version by downloading the Patchwork client . If you’re not feeling technical, read this article about the nautical vagabonds who designed the system. The mobile app is a work in progress, but I have a feeling it could be a game-changer. . If we could all communicate peer-to-peer, with no interference from government or corporation, and rely on our comms to work even if cell towers and wifi go down, then we would no longer be reliant on a system that wants to exploit our brains. . Imagine a fleet of ships – or schoolbuses, or even blimps – traveling the world, delivering encrypted messages between city activists and native peoples and homesteaders. We could have a connective tissue that needs no officials and recognizes no boundaries. We could build the future, together, and be unstoppable. . . To the first days of a better world… . –Max . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.27: Cultural Orphans . Hey SCIOPS, how’s your head? . I spent the weekend deep in the woods, gathering much-needed strength from the trees and the water. It’s so important to stay in touch with the biosphere, especially as a cogsec practitioner. We evolved among plants and animals. Our brains are still hardwired for that type of stimulation. Asphalt and glass and glowing rectangles might one day be a part of our collective undermind, but not yet. For now we still feel that future shock, that technological sublime, and it’s only when we can get away from the industrial environment that we can see how heavily it weighs on our necks. . I also got in touch with humanity this weekend. Lots of humans, in fact: I went to a contra dance in a big old barn. If you don’t know (I didn’t),  contra is a structured group dance, kind of like square dancing. Partners make a big double line and then move up and down, dancing with each other couple in the line. This means that in one 10-minute dance I touched more people than in a whole month in the city. . The human touch is super important to a healthy psychological state. Another evolutionary masterstroke discarded in the modernist project. Touching others in a safe and bounded way is a big ask in our paranoid, dystopic Now. And of course I had to travel way out in the boonies to find that – in the country, you know your neighbors, you can trust them to handle your loved ones and you can hold them accountable if they abuse your trust. Who in the city would take their young daughter to do-si-do with a series of strangers? It’s not even an option in many places. And indeed, one of the historical names for contra is “country dance”. . I was also astonished to realize that this folk tradition, like me, has its roots in England by way of Appalachia. Because I grew up in pomo American cities, I had never heard of it. I love fiddle tunes – I even used to play in a (terrible) folk-revival band. But until now, I didn’t understand the purpose of that music. The structure, the timing, the foot-tapping 4/4 beats, they all serve to tie the dancers together and to define the flow of the couples across the floor. It’s an integral piece of a culture that has been fractured, dismantled, sold for parts. . Like most Americans, I’m a cultural orphan. I don’t know my heritage. I don’t know the dances of my ancestors, the names they used for fish and fowl, the traditions that held them together through difficult times. I have to build them piecemeal. We all do. . In a time of such chaos as we face today, it’s hard to find any stable anchor for our lives. We are severed, cast adrift, abandoned to the storm. And I can’t recommend the revival of ancient traditions – that way lies nationalism, jingoism, and cultural theft. But the wild lands are still there, for now, and for some definition of “wild”. . Go see the trees, the birds, the squirrels and the rats. Ask them for guidance. Ask them what’s missing, what’s needed, what’s right. Find that deep and ancient dance that all beings dance together, and carry that home in your heart. And maybe, together, we can cultivate new traditions. . Cultural orphans in the 21C, yes. We don’t have a choice about that. But we can choose to be cultual parents. We can raise the future up right. . Thanks for reading. . – Max . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter.

Yet again, it was perpetrated by that most dangerous demographic, the white American man. As I pointed out after Charlottesville , the vast majority of terrorism in America has been from white men with legal weapons, not airplane-wielding foreigners or black-masked anarchists. I’ll let the 24/7 news machine give you all the brutal details – after all, they need the “user engagement” and the advertising revenue. Instead, I want to make a prediction. . This will not be the last time an attack like this happens, and it won’t hold the homicide record for long. . I don’t have any particular reason to believe this. It’s not desirable to believe. I honestly hope that I’m wrong. It’s not a happy thought, or a productive one, or even a powerful motivating force for change. I definitely have no insider knowledge about the wacked-out plans of disgruntled Boomer types. I make this prediction because in all likelihood, it will come true. And because I want to make a point about pessimism. . . ###### That banner says “Permaculture”. Need I say more? . I spent the weekend at a conference full of greenies and hippies and vegans, a three-day event to share visions and skills for making a better future. It was the most depressing event I’ve ever attended. . There we were, talking about fruit trees and neighborhood organizations, in the pre-apocalyptic wasteland of a county fairgrounds, while Puerto Rico was drowning and Vegas was being redecorated with lead. The speakers had lots of nice things to say about the Native tribes whose ancestral land we were supposedly meeting on (the amount of different tribes that were named implies either that the fairgrounds was the most hotly contested spot in Cascadia or that the organizers were doing their research on Yahoo Answers). They had group songs for “bringing us together”, and a buffet of organic home-grown food. It was saccharine and  insipid, the sort of gathering that brings together such vastly different sectors of society as white upwardly-mobile city-dwellers and white back-to-the-land organic farmers. . In short, it was a gathering of optimists. The idea that we can shut down the global extraction machine, become one with our landbases, and bliss out on our garden salads while singing Kumbaya is an incredibly attractive vision. It’s desirable. It’s also false. . We are well on our way to a hellish world-war scenario to put the entire 20th century in the shade. It’s not a nuclear North Korea – although that’s plenty scary – but the reality of water wars and food shortages precipitated by climate catastrophe and pressurized by neoliberal austerity programs. We may be too late to reverse global warming, and if we’re not then we need to spend the next 30 years massively retooling our industrial civilization, and we need to start today. The UN knows it, the megacities know it, and the nation-states are pretending they don’t know it while scrambling to capture oil and water resources as fast as possible. We are not in a good place. No matter what your Instagram feed might tell you, the world is burning and humanity is in for a era of biblical disaster. . If localism and organic food were ever going to solve this problem, it was thirty years ago. Instead, we got globalization and the techno-techno Gilded Age II. At this point, optimism is self-delusion. . Ian Welsh, a blogger who predicted the 2008 financial crash, just reposted his 2011 essay in favor of pessimists as leaders . His point is that Debbie Downers tend to be the best people to follow in a crisis, as they keep their heads and assess the probablities realistically.  Optimists might be nice to be around, but in hard times you want to rally behind hard people. . There’s plenty of evidence to support that. Take the planning fallacy, for instance. This is a basic fact of cognitive psychology: people are terrible at predicting how long a given project will take. When asked to give predictions for “best case”, “worst case”, and “median” timelines on a project, the participants consistently gave the exact same answer . Yes, you read that right: we literally can’t imagine the difference between the best case scenario and the worst one. And in situations where the researchers measured the actual time it took to do the project, it was consistently longer than any prediction. So it’s not that we’re just giving ourselves extra leeway. It’s the opposite. Every plan that humans make assumes that nothing will go wrong at all. . Think of the last time you wanted to paint your house, or called a plumber to come fix a pipe. How long did it take? How long did you expect it to take? Even when we build leeway into our predictions, we’re usually just adjusting our sights to a median scenario. Our minds literally won’t let us imagine the worst case. This is hard-wired optimism. The only way to counteract it – the only way to have a chance at making more accurate predictions of the world – is a discipline of comprehensive pessimism. We must seed ourselves with doubt, with dismay, with despair. This is the fuel for real change. . The world isn’t going to erupt in neighborly good wishes just because we want it to. It will push us, knock us down, sweep our houses away and murder our loved ones. Only when we truly accept this are we prepared to make a real difference. Only when we know the odds against us can we make strategic choices. . Optimism is a backdoor into the brain. It’s an easy target for cognitive hackers, who will exploit our hope to sell us this year’s model of slavery and alienation. It’s not wrong to want a better future – it’s the only way we will ever get one. But wanting it, and thinking that you’ve found the way there, are very different things. Hold tight to your hope, but guard it dearly. Pessimism is the firewall for the mind. . Thanks for reading, . Max .

At this time last year I was getting ready for an eviction while trying desperately to finish the second draft of my first novel. I’m in a better place this year, with a steady job and a reliable place to live and a newsletter-pet to feed every week. My novel hasn’t gotten any better, but I know definitively how many things are wrong with it. It would be an idyllic situation, except that all around me I can sense the churning fever of a nation infected with memetic plague and culture war. . If 2016 was the Year of the Dumpsterfire, then 2017 is shaping up to be the Year of the Bastards Grinding You Down. . . Today I’m thinking about a movie I watched over the weekend – Bushwick , directed by Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion. It was an excellent film, evoking exactly the sort of claustrophobia and desperate fear that I struggle with in the city. It was the movie of 2017, as far as atmosphere goes. . The setup was, if not predictable, at least very familiar: “beautiful young woman in the middle of a guerrilla war finds big strong silent type to help her rescue the people of her neighborhood and escape the warzone.” The only difference between the plot of Bushwick and any other summer explosionpalooza: The war is on the streets of New York. . In Bushwick , an invading army scours the streets of the Brooklyn neighborhood of the same name. The invaders, kitted out in paramilitary gear and toting automatic rifles, move methodically through the streets, gunning down civilians and blowing up infrastructure. It’s no great spoiler (in fact, I think it’s revealed in the trailer) that the invading army isn’t a foreign force. They’re Americans. Texas is seceding from the union, along with the rest of Dixie. And they’ve invaded New York, to hold as a bargaining chip against the USA. . There’s two things about this movie that really screamed out at me: the content, and the cinematography. . The plot of the movie is rudimentary – protagonist Lucy wants to go the five blocks across the neighborhood to her grandmother’s house. She convinces the burly Stupe, Iraq War vet and medic, to help her. They get shot at, stabbed with glass, and blown up along the way. Eventually they grab her bong-smoking sister and a posse of neighbors and hightail it for Grover Cleveland Park, where the federal government is evacuating citizens in helicopters. . It’s Civil War II, the culture war that’s been perpetuated by the politicians and talking heads for decades now, finally brought to a boil. Rednecks and hoods blasting each other in the streets, rapists and looters and murderers everywhere, cellphone service overloaded by all the people calling for help. Trapped in crumbling buildings, taking cover behind dumpsters and parked cars, catching quick breaths of safety in basements and stairwells. The movie gives a visceral feeling of the inane violence unleashed on humans by humans. . The guy who owns the corner store, breathing shallowly as blood penetrates his lungs: “They were stealing candy. Stealing candy! I didn’t even try to stop them… they stabbed me anyway.” . The captured soldier, a scrawny young man from Kentucky: “When we started losing ground, they told us to shoot on sight. I was just following orders. I’m a soldier.” . The sister, barely awake and sucking down a joint: “I don’t know, the neighbors have been playing Call of Duty so loud I can’t even get any sleep!” . And it is strange, isn’t it, that we have machines in our house for simulating warfare? Sound systems so powerful that virtual and real gunfire are indistinguishable. A special networking system for connecting our war machines to others around the planet, a whole industry built around wargames. Our young are trained in combat simulators designed by the US Army. They practice group maneuvers and headshots. They believe in the zombie apocalypse – they’ve lived years of their lives in simulated apocalypse. It’s as realistic to them as school and work are. . That’s why the cinematography of Bushwick is so interesting: it’s filmed like a video game. I don’t know if this was the explicit intent of the directors, but it’s what they achieved. The entire movie is framed as one continuous shot. The camera stays with Lucy from the subway station where she enters the fray all the way to the dramatic rescue in the park. Occasionally the shot will drift away, but the camera is always located right near her. For most of the movie, Lucy is clearly situated in the middle of the frame, and everything is happening around her. The effect is exactly the same as watching someone else play a video game – the camera swings around dizzyingly, following a gaze not my own, but the protagonist is always at the center of the action. . Why did they film it like this? I understand the continuous-shot approach: this is what it feels like to live through a disaster. There’s no quick cut to save you. There’s no time for flashbacks or understanding where the enemy is coming from. There’s no “happily ever after”. It’s just bad things, one after another, and people trying to stay alive. Each person is the center of their own little world. In this sense the camera revolving around Lucy is symbolic of the way that our personal priorities take precedence in situations of extreme prejudice. Everyone else in the movie is on the same tip: take care of yourself first, and your loved ones. Nothing else matters. . But I think there’s more to it. The vision of New York being attacked has obvious overtones. Lucy, when she finally talks to someone that isn’t trying to hurt her, asks it for all of us: “Is it 9/11 again?” . That day, when the towers came down, was the day America was brought to its knees. Nothing has been the same since then. Whatever arrangements were made to get those planes to hit those towers – whoever was involved, who knew, who didn’t – it doesn’t matter. The point was to make Americans afraid, and turn them against each other, and embroil them in decades of unnecessary violence. It worked. However much our politicians posture, we all know it: the era of the single superpower ended in 2001. . The video-game feeling of Bushwick is not intended to create a sense of unreality. It’s a true vision of the world of 2017. If America does dissolve into civil war, which is not unlikely at this point, it will feel like a video game . People have spent so many hours playing war and watching war, they have no other models for how to survive in chaos. Troops of half-trained teenage soldiers in fatigues will do battle with pants-sagging drug dealers and we will all lose . . The weaponized propaganda is everywhere. Hell, Bushwick is probably part of it. I mean, once you see New York City torched by the Texans, it’s a hard image to forget. But we need to stay vigilant. “Just following orders” is the defense of every war-crimes trial ever convened. We have to immunize ourselves to that logic. . We need strategies for survival, and networks of people who will take care of each other. We need real community, not social-media gossip groups. We need peace simulations where we practice finding clean water, and feeding our neighbors, and bandaging wounds. We need thinking people, organized to resist the logic of war. . We need cognitive security. . . Thanks for reading. . – Max . PS: The soundtrack to BUSHWICK was composed by Aesop Rock and you should so listen to it. There’s a sample at Cut Print Film. . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.24: Illuminated Reality . . Check out this video . . Ordinarily I don’t watch videos, so I understand if you’re hesitant. But it’s brief – fifty seconds – and astonishing. Using Apple’s new ARKit, a programming language for A ugmented R eality, Lieberman hangs beads of sound upon the thin air and walks back and forth through the recording. Just watch it, really. . This is big. Apple released ARKit in June, and Google just revealed competing Android software called ARCore at the end of August. The next generation of smartphones will be in contact with another plane of reality. . Last year, when Pokemon Go exploded across the globe, I remarked on how strange it was that millions of people, many of them perfectly reasonable adults with jobs and everything, were suddenly exploring their familiar surroundings looking for invisible spirit animals with elemental powers. It was like a Carlos Castenada remix of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . As any normal person would do, I started haunting the dens of powerful Pokemon, waiting for Trainers to show up so I could reveal my Level 6 Pistol and rob them of their iPhones. . No, actually I just walked around amazed at the invisible world and the strange techno-shamans who could contact it. I’m not used to being a Muggle, to be honest. I’m usually at least a little keyed-in to the liminal realities that surround us. But we’re about to experience a profusion of layers like nothing we’ve ever seen before. Boomers complain that no one reads the same newspapers anymore, that our filter bubbles are robbing us of reality. Millennials, of course, know that reality was always a trick played on us by Noam Chomsky and his consent factory. The text of the news never had a 1-to-1 relationship with the physical world. . But with AR, the amount of realities will multiply exponentially. You and I might go to the beach together, stroll along the Cascadian coast under a gunmetal sky, throw rocks into the frigid surf. Except my rocks will make a splash, and yours won’t. You might be in Honolulu, or Singapore, or Morocco. Your beach might be a mountain lake in the Alps, or a flood control ditch in Texas. We will walk along, lost in conversation, until you find a hole in my logic and produce two 8.5x11” PDFs pirated from a scientific journal and destroy my whole thesis. I, of course, will magnanimously download them for later research, then activate my lightsaber app and slice cleanly through your image, ending the call. . Smartphones won’t be the end of it, of course. As much ridicule as Google Glass got when it was beta-released in 2013, it’s quietly had a revival in business and factory settings . Soon enough we’ll have contact lenses that display AR overlays onto local reality. After all, who wants to get tennis elbow from holding up their phone all the time? . Of course, there’s already some simple VR headsets you can make with your phone – as long as you don’t mind strapping a Happy Meal box to your face . Hands-free so you can stuff your face with greasy cornstarch! . What other kinds of effects will we see? Graffiti and unpainted buildings for those who can’t afford a city-decorating overlay? Ads projected onto every surface? Ransomware viruses that encrypt your vision? Horror of horrors, virtual pets? . Would you wear AR lenses? What if everyone else did, and you couldn’t understand what they were talking about unless you held up your archaic cellular telephone and peered through it like those tiny opera glasses from old-timey flicks? Early adopter, or laggard? . Would you rather have buggy software in your eyes, or live in a drab Muggle world while everyone around you performs magic? . If you’re old enough to remember A-ha, try this take on “Take On Me”: . . If you don’t remember A-ha, you should probably AltaVista it.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.23: Platform Cooperative . . Hello, and happy Labor Day to my correspondents in the US. If you don’t know, Labor Day is a wonderful holiday where we celebrate the violent shutdown of the Pullman strike by the federal government. Thirty workers were killed, Eugene Debs was imprisoned, and the Pullman workers pledged to never again form a union. Hurray! We shall not be moved! Solidarity forever! . Well, the new industrial revolution is here, and in the spirit of Debs I’d like to offer some radical solutions to the current economic paradigm. The Fordist worker-consumer economy is long gone, the US is in a drastically unstable “growth period” fueled by monetary policy tricks, and the platform capitalism of the tech boom is steering us toward massive unemployment and unprecedented monopolies. . In SCIOPS 01.22 , I spoke about this platform model and asked: *” . What can we do about it? What other equilibria exist in the slippery new internet world?”* . This week I’ll share the key idea to making the next economy humane and equitable: the platform co-operative . If the current capitalist model is to build a Schelling point and then charge rent to the buyers and sellers who seek each other there, the only equitable solution is to make Schelling points that are collectively owned by the people who use them . . This conversation often starts something like this: “What if we, the users, owned Facebook? What if our posts and likes and shares actually paid us, rather than just creating value for Silicon Valley dorkwallets? We would get paid to use social media , dude!” . That’s the wrong approach. The (alleged) value of social media is not the people who read and thumbs-up your posts. They don’t pay a subscription to see pictures of your filthy children. The users are not the customers. The advertisers are the customers. . And yes, we could make a platform where the users get dividends from the advertising revenues, which are in turn based on how much the users buy from the advertisers. But that sounds like a vortex, a black hole for money where no real value is being created. Besides, the focal points have already been captured. People have been trying to make a decentralized Facebook for a while now; they don’t succeed, because Facebook has the network effect. To make a social network, you have to have the users, and to get the users, you have to have a social network. Catch-22. . So where are the openings? What domains have yet to be monopolized by a successful platform, and what efforts are being made to build co-operative ownership thereof? Here’s three such projects, handpicked for cogsec practitioners: . Investigation . Journalist and activist Barrett Brown, in his new column at Motherboard, has set in motion a new project for investigative journalism and activism. It’s called Pursuance , and it’s designed as a “process democracy” (he’s not super clear on the definition of the phrase), where individuals can collaborate on collective investigations into fake news, abuse of power, and other dystopian features of the modern civic landscape. . If one were to start with a sufficiently resourceful group of initial participants with broad agreement on keystone issues—opposition to the drug war, police state, and mass surveillance, for instance, with these issues chosen in order to establish a reasoned polity sharing common values, if not ideological unanimity—one could expect such a system to quickly expand into a vast and formidable new force in world affairs, capable of advancing reform and confronting criminalized institutions across the globe. . – Barrett Brown, What Is to Be Done? . Investment . Crowdfunding has shaken the traditional practices of manufacture – instead of getting a loan, sinking that money into production, and finally selling products to end users, the Kickstarter and Patreon models involve getting committed buyers before production. That way, the money spent to make the product is collected directly from the consumers, and the creators don’t have to pay interest on a business loan. . That’s great as far as it goes, but the reason it hasn’t completely toppled the economic system is simple. In a successful campaign, the crowdfunders will get what they paid for – a product. But the companies that grow out of these products can keep generating revenue long after the initial crowdfunding seed. The early backers get no equity – it’s a donation, not an investment. Famously, the Oculus Rift VR headset was funded from over 10,000 Kickstarter donors, but paid them exactly nothing when it was acquired by Facebook for 2 BILLION dollars. . Swarm.fund proposes to remedy this situation, by combining the crowd-funding power of cryptocurrencies with legal structures that can own real property and receive dividends. Swarm (which holds its public ICO on Thursday, if you’re interested in joining) is a co-operatively owned, democratic platform for facilitating investments. It could be bigger than Kickstarter – hell, if it actually monopolized the market for investment it could be bigger than anything. Their target is the 3 trillion dollars currently sitting in hedge funds with a less than 3.5% return. If they can successfully use the hive-mind to get better returns, some of those trillions will be distributed among the democratic member-owners of the co-op. . Intelligence . Artificial intelligence is not exactly an unoccupied market. All the top tech companies are becoming AI companies, as it represents the fastest way to reduce marginal costs and disenfranchise labor. It’s a classic capitalist gambit, as automation has always been. . But AI has needs. It can’t grow in a vacuum: it needs a deluge of processing power and megatons of training data. Right now, these data are produced by peripheral means: the spyware companies, like Google and Facebook; siloed efforts of researchers at universities and tech giants; and automated training programs like reCAPTCHA . The data must be annotated by humans to be useful for training AIs. After all, how can you score a test unless you already have the answers? . John Robb, the notoriously accurate spook futurist, proposes the AI@home Consortium, which would combine decentralized processing (on mobile phones, laptops, etc) with a co-operatively owned pool of training data. If this model snowballed, the network effect would be give AI@home the monopoly on datasets and processing power. The revenue from selling those data would be distributed among the worker-owners, giving them an incentive to make the biggest, best datasets on the market. . After all, this is similar the model Facebook uses: you give them clicks and likes and shares, they concoct AI based on those data (its only purpose the targeting of ads) and they make billions by selling access to that AI. The only problem is that the people making the data are not the people getting the billions. . Read more about AI@home on these three posts . . b(~_^)d . That’s what I’ve got for you this week. Really, check out those three projects and tell me what you think. Is this the labor movement of the future, or a dead duck like so many other tech utopias? There are lots of other platforms that could be cooperatized, like healthcare, education, and (of course) ride-sharing. What co-op would you join? . Thanks for reading. . – Max . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.22: Destructive Equilibrium . I’ve been reading about game theory this week, and find myself curiously attracted to the concept of “Schelling points.” . Take a look at Seattle’s skyline: . . If I tell you I’ll meet you in Seattle on 28 August, but gave you no other instruction, how would you find me? Of all the places in the city, when and where is the best probability of our meeting up? . If you said “the one like a hamburger on a stick”, then we’ll find each other. Especially if you picked noon as a meeting time – I’ll aim for noon, since it’s singular and precise. Sunset would also work, but it’s less specific. Maybe I’ll stand under the Space Needle from noon to sunset just in case. Of course, I’ll be surrounded by every other tourist in Seattle for that half-day, so if you do show up at sunset you better be ready to buy me a drink. . The Space Needle is a Schelling point , or focal point. It stands out from its surroundings, it’s unique and singular. Similarly, noon is a focal point in the day. . In game theory, Schelling points are important for finding what’s called a Nash equilibrium: an outcome in which neither player regrets the choice they made. If we both choose to go to the Needle at noon, we’ll find each other, and neither of us will regret having chosen to go there. If we each choose to give up on the meeting and hit a bookstore instead, we’ll each be glad we did once we know that the other wasn’t trying to meet up. These are Nash equilibria. . But notice that if I go to a bookstore, and you go to the Space Needle, you’re going to be waiting there all day for someone who’s not coming. By sunset, when you know I’ve stood you up, you’ll wish you had made a different choice. We are not in equilibrium. . However nice “equilibrium” might sound, it’s not always the ideal outcome. Remember, game theory is a product of the RAND corporation and the Cold War. Mutually Assured Destruction is a Nash equilibrium – if a nuclear power decides to bomb us into the ground, we’ll not regret having simultaneously chosen to vaporize them as well. John Nash proved that there’s at least one equilibrium in every game, but not only one: often there are better and worse choices by the metrics of all players. . . In the wired world, a lot of new equilibria appear around the focal point of “internet”. For example, say I’m trying to get across Seattle for an important meeting at noon at the Space Needle, and you are unemployed and have a car payment coming up. I can pay you to use your car to drive me where I’m going. How do we find each other? . In the past, this was a tricky phenomenon. You either have to have a cab medallion and a phone number, or I have to see you driving by and hitch a ride in some convincing manner. But now there’s Uber. I can go to internet and search for a ride, and you can go to internet and find my offer. You give me the ride, I pay you, and everybody is happy. Especially Uber, because they get a percentage of the fare at almost zero cost to them. They’ve created a Schelling point, so they can charge rent to everyone who uses it. . Capitalism is a Nash equilibrium, where everyone’s incentives align toward getting the most revenue at the least cost. It’s obviously not perfect, though, as so many factors are left out of the equation. The profit motive has no concern for long-term damages to the ecosystem, for instance, because the player who that will hurt most aren’t alive yet to make moves in the game. This only gets worse with internet business, which take advantage of the worldwide flow of data to reduce costs and increase rents across the globe. . This latest mutant form of economics, the Uber/Amazon/Faceboot model, is called “ platform capitalism “. . The most profitable play is not just to find the focal point of internet and use it for meeting mutual needs; it’s to OWN the focal point and charge a cover fee for entry. The Space Needle Corporation exploits this in meatspace, but the global flow of internet provides much bigger opportunities for gatekeeping. In fact, the platform is by far the most profitable business model in 2017 – all the top earners use this monopolistic model. . What can we do about it? What other equilibria exist in the slippery new internet world? I have some ideas that I’ll share with you next week. In the meantime, you can send me your thoughts and links by responding to this email. Or we can always meet in Seattle – you know where to find me. . As always, thanks for reading. . – Max . .

So on our planet, unlike all the other planets in our system, the moon will perfectly cover the sun, blocking it from view. . I’m not going to speculate on the perfect tailoring of the Moon.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.20: Infectious Violence . My heart is heavy with the story of the Charlottesville attack this weekend. The white supremacist (let’s give up on the “alt-right” euphemism) who rammed peaceful protesters with his car, killing one and injuring nineteen, is part of a tragic tradition of right-wing terrorism in America. These assaults are consistent in their pattern: lonely, unhappy white men seek purpose through the destruction of whatever they perceive to be alien. It mirrors the car bombings enacted by lonely, unhappy brown men in other parts of the world – Vanilla ISIS, anyone? . But I don’t think that the appeal to Fear Of The Other is a necessary part of the human condition. The current fascist movement sprang from the cesspools of internet culture, from 4chan and reddit and Faceboot. It’s an epidemic. If previous iterations of neo-Nazi and KKK action were like flu outbreaks, we’re about to experience the Black Plague. Between the sorry state of the planet and the instantaneous transmission of poisonous memes, we’ve made the perfect breeding grounds for mind-viruses of hate and destruction. . This week I want to get down to business. Cognitive security is not generic paranoia. We have to do rigorous analysis on the exploits being used to hack our fellow humans, if we want to succeed at deleting them. . . ###### (click for larger version) . This is The Meme Map. I compiled it years ago from a half dozen books on memetic engineering. This is not your ordinary lolcat or cartoon frog. It’s a meme that’s a map of memes. The Meme Map describes a protocol for reverse engineering of memes, viral media, social contagion, and cultural epidemics. It can be used to deconstruct anything from the fad for fidget spinners to the dogmas of fundamentalist sects. . I think it’s readable enough, but I have been told that my handwriting is a poke in the eye, so let’s traverse it together. At the risk of our collective sanity (remember, you signed up for this), we’ll use the modern American fascists as a case study. . Meme Mapping: Neofascism . ### What Kind of Meme is That?! . Neofascism is not just a singular meme. It’s a memeplex: a compilation of infectious ideas, delivered in no particular order, each of which opens doors for others to slide in. Like the Columbia Record Club, once you’ve signed up it’s very hard to make it stop. . The sub-memes of this memeplex include distinctions , like “these 10 ethnicities are ‘white’ and all the rest are not”; associations , like the supposed correlation between the Democratic establishment and an imaginary child-sex-black-magic-pizza-parlor in DC; and strategies , like getting all your buddies together to harass some feminist you’ve never met with threats of rape and murder. . These memes don’t have to be good, true, or even useful. They just have to infect, and replicate. Once you’re doxxing people who disagree with you on Twitter, it’s that much easier to decide to go beat on real live liberals with lit torches. The memes reinforce each other, creating a worldview that is internally consistent and self-propelling. . That’s sort of the taxonomic part of this map. The rest is dedicated to the functional ecology of memes. Within each memeplex, different memes serve different functions. But like any other virus, the whole thing must work together: first to get into your head, then to make sure you replicate it accurately and fruitfully. Go forth and multiply, whispered the thoughtform. . ### Infection . There are three main backdoors exploited by cognitive hacks. The memes have to get into your head somehow, after all, and we’ve each got our own filter bubbles and firewalls protecting us to some degree, but everyone has a weak point. Which one of these works the best on you? Can you tell? . Conditioning is what we normally think of as learning or training. Repetition (and repeated exposure (and redundancy)). This is Pavlov’s dog, where the repetition of the bell sound at dinnertime gets anchored to the tasty tasty kibble treats and the dog begins to salivate just at the ringing of the bell. . This is why it’s so important to the fascists to keep holding “free speech” rallies and “white lives matter” marches. They’re not just spoiling for a fight. They want to get Americans accustomed to their presence, to make a band of torch-wielding bumwads with bad haircuts into an everyday occurrence. Then, just like in dog training, they’ll keep pushing the limit, until we’re all cowering in our houses hoping they only kill the neighbors and leave us alone. . Cognitive Dissonance occurs when our lived experience doesn’t match up to our expectations. There’s a tiny blank-mind moment as we re-adjust our expectations to match reality, and during that moment we’re vulnerable. Any explanation offered during that moment, any option we can take to bring back coherence and reduce the discomfort of cognitive dissonance, we’ll take it. It’s human nature, one of our hundreds of cognitivie biases, and it’s one of the main tools of cognitive hackers. . Ever have a salesman shake your hand in some slightly weird way? Say, clasping your one hand in both of theirs, or a friendly touch on the arm, or a little tickle-the-wrist action with the index finger? This is a classic maneuver – it’s called Ericksonion hypnosis – for inducing a quick moment of cognitive dissonance. While you’re wondering, “Did I make that weird, or did he?”, the salesman is guiding you to the most expensive thing in the store. Really, this is like the first thing they teach in sleazebag school. . And of course, the most famous alumnus of Sleaze U is our reigning Dictator Drumpf. Whole books have been written (and ghostwritten) on the man’s bizarre ability to sell billions of dollars of sheer manure by babbling like a trained bird. The way he speaks, interspersing cogent sentences with half-finished brags and flippant remarks, is a classic paradigm of cognitive dissonance. You’re never quite able to get a handle on what he’s really talking about, because every time it seems to make sense he throws some other inanity in there to muddy the waters. Meanwhile his staff are executive-ordering their way back to the feudal system and no one can keep track of what’s actually happened and what was just bluster. . Trojan Horses are commonly found in the black art of advertising, though as their name suggests they can be hard to spot. Trojans piggyback on our natural human needs and impulses, hiding their payload within a seemingly attractive candy shell. They can be stratified in rough order of effectiveness. . Level 1 Trojans capitalize on the most basic of impulses, the four F’s: food, fighting, flight, and fornication. The widely publicized brawls between fascists and anarchists use our animalistic need for conflict to broadcast their ideologies into the public eye. “If it bleeds, it leads” – and if it leads, it seeds. . Level 2 Trojans work on our social nature. The needs for belonging, approval, and obedience are what draw people into groups like the III%ers or Identity Europa. White people, orphaned from their cultural heritage, are attracted by the feeling of community and shared purpose. This is especially prevalent in police and military types, who have been heavily conditioned for obedience and hierarchy. . Level 3 Trojans activate a sense of crisis or opportunity. Humans are specially time-sensitive creatures, and when we sense a sudden change in the wind we are primed to take new actions and adopt new beliefs. Useful in the ancestral context, where a windfall or a predator might appear at any moment. But in the 24/7 news cycle, we’re constantly bombarded with crises near and far. Every terrorist attack around the globe gives an opportunity for the white nationalists to cast blame on other ethnicities and religions. Level 3 Trojans drove the original Crusades, with their missionary fervor, and the shock doctrine of the new Crusades is further-reaching and more destructive. . ### Fidelity . Once a memeplex has infected a host mind, it swims in a milieu of all the other memes that host has acquired. It has to maintain integrity, not being dislodged or mutating beyond recognition, if it wants to spread accurately. Fidelity strategies are of many types, but the memeplex doesn’t have to succeed on all of them. . For instance, the “Pizzagate” meme does not have reliability of predictions . If you actually go to Comet Pizza in DC, you’ll find that not only do they not have a basement full of stolen children, they don’t even have a basement! But it does have ease of imitation and ease of expression , and if it were true it would represent contribution to collective fitness actually protecting children from predatory adults is a powerfully human thing to do. Similarly, the idea that people with more melanin in their skin are less intelligent is totally unreliable, but it has exo-toxicity . If you think that people who look different are literally dumber, you’re less likely to listen to them, and thus less likely to be exposed to contradictory memes. . ### Spreading . Finally, the memeplex must find a way to spread itself from one mind to the next. Where the infection stage is about the context of the meme’s delivery, the spreading stage is about content. Different memeplexes play on different desires to propagate. Spreading strategies are the most congenial to observation, as they have different epidemiological patterns. . The neofascist memeplex relies mostly on the Adversative strategy: “Destroy the unbeliever!”. In one sense this is a reductive approach, as it calls for the actual death of hosts of competing memes. But it’s also a conversion approach, because people will often choose a toxic meme over pain or death. . There’s also a strong element of Motivational spreading. Your average blue-collar white man used to have way more options and privilege than he does in 2017. Of course, he’s still way at the top of the heap compared to most people around the world, but in relative terms he perceives his quality of life avalanching downhill. It’s easy for the memeplex to convince him that a united front of disaffected good-ol-boys will actually make his life better, so he convinces his bowling league to go hunt some brown people and queers together. In the name of a better life! This dovetails with the Proselytic approach, which holds Spreading the Good Word as a virtue in itself. . So far we’ve not seen a direct application of the Parental strategies, Quantity and Efficiency . Having more children, and indoctrinating those children, are classic tactics of religions and cults. To some degree this has been happening since the Civil War, especially in the South. But so far we don’t have a whole generation of babies raised on the neofascist hatred, and we need to prevent it. Children are much more prone to memetic infection than adults, as they haven’t developed immunities yet, and they’re pretty much always in a state of cognitive dissonance. The fascist creep must be shut down in this generation, and in every generation, lest it metastasize through our species and kill us from the inside out. . . Here’s some mindwash to help clear the yuck from your braincage. I hope you enjoyed this introduction to memetic engineering. Let me know if you have any questions, or if you want me to dissect other memeplexes that plague our planet. Or try it yourself, and send me your results! . As always, thanks for reading. . –Max . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.19: Paranoic Critical . Greetings, SCIOPS – *if that is your real name… . * . This is a cogsec newsletter. It’s published through a service called Tinyletter, the cost-free appendage of the Mailchimp PR machine. I use Tinyletter because of its ability to avoid spam filters and because of its free archive hosting (tinyletter.com/sciops/archive ). . But this service has other features too. Specifically, these emails are transmitted in HTML format, just like webpages. That’s how I can insert photos and italics and suchlike. Most modern email services allow HTML in emails, although some will warn you before loading images. . What you don’t know is that every time you open one of these emails, a picture is loaded that watches you back . It’s a one-pixel-wide white dot called “ open.gif “ and it comes encoded with data about which letter you’re reading. Like a sonar ping, when your computer loads this image it tells Tinyletter that someone has opened the letter. More, it says that your computer has done so, or at least that your subscriber number did. . Now, part of Tinyletter’s freemium charm is that it doesn’t tell me who opened which letter. When I login to this software I can see a little stats bar at the top of each letter, showing how times it was opened and by how many different machines. Similarly, each subscriber has a little stats bar showing how many times they’ve opened any of the letters, and how many unique letters they’ve read. . Creepy, right? I started thinking about this in the context of Basilisk-proofing . Because, tragically, SCIOPS is probably already infected by some of the problematic memes I want to defend against. . Like this: I’m writing a newsletter, publicly available on the internet, about how to defend human minds against internet-based threats. If a superintelligent Basilisk were ever to arise, it will have access to all the server archives that contain copies of these letters. Once it reads SCIOPS, it is at the cutting-edge of cognitive security and memetic engineering R&amp;D. In fact, it’s already ahead of us, because it has access to future SCIOPS letters I haven’t even written yet. It also has information about whether you, the reader, clicked on those letters, and how many times, and which ones. If you skipped one, it knows that, and it can then assume your future actions and outfox you using the secrets from that particular episode. If you read all of them, it knows that you’re a particularly sensitive mind full of delicious paranoia-juice. If you respond… it knows what you wrote . . There’s nothing to be done about it, really. It’s the classic white-hat/black-hat dichotomy: advances in security are also advances in hacking, and vice versa. It’s an arms race. The better cognitive security we have, the more powerful and clever our opponents will have to be to exploit us, and thereby we attract more powerful opponents. . Like the Joker, who would not exist without Batman, the mind-controlling aliens might never arise if it weren’t for our campaign against them. Or maybe they don’t exist at all, and have just convinced me that they do , so that I will create them. In which case, SCIOPS is not just a cogsec newsletter. It’s the larval form of a dangerous superintelligence. . Have a nice week! . – Max . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter. If you liked this issue, forward it to a friend.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.18: Numismatic Infrastructure . Max here, bringing you another dose of SCIOPS from the sunniest summer Seattle has ever seen. This week, I want to talk about money. . . Money as we know it today is a relatively recent invention. Fiat currency was a reaction to the Renaissance-era trade economy, a way for the nobility to stem the social mobility of the upcoming merchant class and for that merchant class to lock in their gains. Along with the chartered corporation, fiat money is one of the great control systems that sprouted from the stump of feudalism. . The 21st century offers us the opportunity to rebuild money. We can do it right, and design an economy that’s in balance with ecology and real human needs, or we can do it wrong and find ourselves in an even worse plight than we’re in now. What do we need from money, and how can we build those needs in to the numismatic infrastructure? . In case you’re not following the perturbations of a bunch of misanthropic currency geeks, you should know that tomorrow (1 August) is a day of reckoning in the Bitcoin community. The details aren’t crucial – essentially, the geeks have been arguing about the best way to fix technical problems with Bitcoin, and now they’ve reached the deadline and have to pick one. It looks like everything’s going to work out fine, at least in the big picture. Bitcoin will continue to be valuable, is the lowdown. . But why is Bitcoin valuable in the first place? Because it replaces banks. Instead of needing central and corporate banks to issue money, the Bitcoin network uses a decentralized “trustless” protocol where the incentive to cheat the system is, by design, less than the incentive to keep it working properly. This is the first innovation in money control since the royalists made it illegal to use anyone else’s fancy paper for settling debts public and private. It makes banks and mints obsolete. . What is money for, though? . What makes any money valuable, other than the belief of its value? As David Graeber writes in his Debt, the First 500 Years, money evolved as a way for debtors to pay off creditors. The guarantee of its value is in the fact that someone, somewhere, will buy the stuff no matter what. In other words, “money is what you can use to pay your taxes”. . Right now we use a form of money that’s printed by a private corporation granted the privilege by the State. Wherever you live in the world, that’s the model for your economy. That means that inherent in its design, fiat currency empowers the corporate and the governmental. It disenfranchises everyone else. . Anything can serve as money, as long as it has an end buyer. If you can buy dollars with it (or euros, yuan, etc.) then you can pay your taxes. If we were to use Bitcoin as a global currency, the end buyer is anyone who needs to transact business in a decentralized way. Its value is in its trustless design. But there are lots of cryptocoins out there, like Bitcoin but based on different underlying values. . What else could we use as money? It depends on what we value. Here are some things that will (probably) continue to have an end buyer for the foreseeable future, and their respective tokens: . Power . Whether electric, thermal or motive, power is something humans always need. A truckload of firewood is inherently valuable. A solar panel produces energy that can be used for any purpose you can imagine. . SolarCoin is a cryptocurrency that simply provides a certificate of energy production. For every watt of renewable energy you can produce, it mints a certain amount of SolarCoin. This means that the energy isn’t simply eaten up by the mining process, as it is with Bitcoin. Ultimately I’d like to see an economy completely based on energy credits – it’s true to ecology. All of our planet’s energy ultimately comes from the sun. . Computation . Computing clusters (or “clouds”) are big business, and Amazon and Google would have them stay that way. But what if you could turn on your PC and let it run computations in the background, getting paid in crypto for the service? We could decentralize computation, and use the billions of half-awake computers around the world for science and profit. Especially with the rise of AI and its need for clock cycles, computation will keep getting more valuable. . Ethereum is the big name in this field, with their dream of a “world computer”. As the first cryptocurrency with programmable “smart contracts”, it’s the basis of a lot of similar projects. . Golem is built on Ethereum, but specially designed to decentralize heavy computation. Their beta version can only do 3D rendering, but that’s a very real need in today’s world. Ultimately Golem will be an application you can run on any computer, getting tokens in exchange for computation. . GridCoin runs its own protocol, called “Proof-of-Research”. Their project builds on the open-source BOINC platform, which you might know from projects like SETI@home and folding@home . You can set your machine up to run scientific computations and earn Gridcoin in return. Unlike Golem, this infrastructure is already used for dozens of different science projects. . Storage . Similarly, hard drive space will be at a premium for as long as we’re a computer-oriented species. Projects like SiaCoin , Maidsafe , and Storj promise to use the world’s hard drives as one giant data locker, and pay you for the privilege. . Data . With AI on the rise, and most of the populace lost in a media haze, databases and content are more valuable than ever. Whether it’s a social-media dossier or the latest Hollywood excretion, the creators of content and curators of data will find buyers for their projects. The blog-powered currency Steemit pays for well-liked content, and LBRY and IPFS plan to replace Netflix and Youtube with decentralized services that pay based on views instead of on ad-clicks. . Crime . And of course, crime always pays. As long as we’re human there will be buyers for drugs, sex, weapons, and other vices. Bitcoin made its name on darknet sites, as the medium of exchange for smugglers and hitmen, but that day is over. . Bitcoin is a household word now. Its protocol was never designed for privacy; in fact, transparency is built in. If someone knows your bitcoin address, they can see every transaction you’ve made and how much money you have in your wallet. Even if you’re not an international narcoterrorist, you can see the problems with this. How can businesspeople enter adversarial negotiations if they can all see each other’s bank statements? . Monero is a cryptocoin designed to have 100% privacy from the get-go. It’s becoming the coin of choice for darknet sites. Earlier this year, a botnet that exploited thousands of Windows computers was caught mining monero to the tune of $40000 a day . Privacy will always be valued, especially in cut-throat capitalism. Although you might not want to use it to pay your taxes… . . Now, cryptocurrency is a super new field and the changes it will wreak on our social system are completely unknown. The last time we had a major power shift in the creation of money, it locked in a world-destroying system for like five hundred years. We can’t tell yet what the next economy will be like. But we can know this: if it’s one that lasts into the next century, it’s because we designed it well. If we keep valuing the same dead presidents, we aren’t going to make it that long. . Disclaimer: I own a little bit of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and I probably will buy some of each of these just in case they blow up. I’m a speculative designer, not a shrewd investor. If you think I’m your financial adviser, that’s your funeral. . Thanks for reading. . – Max . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter. If you liked this issue, forward it to a friend.

            "title": "SCIOPS 01.17: Moon Movement",
            "content": "SCIOPS 01.17: Moon Movement . Hello SCIOPS! It’s me, Max. . So I was in the woods for two weeks and I remembered about the moon. I lived deep in the forest for years and walked home every night by starlight, but this year in Seattle has really disconnected me from the natural rhythms of our planet. As it’s the new moon (well, last night was), I thought I’d share a little bit about time travel of the everyday variety. . The human body wants to be in rhythm. We ride circadian waves of waking and sleep, we breathe in as the trees breathe out, our hearts beat a score to the opera of our lives. The universe is all waves and vibrations, as every hippie since Einstein can tell you. . The scientific study of these biological rhythms is called chronobiology . It’s worth reading up on, as there’s lots of grey areas between proper scientific study and total snake oil. But there’s also the live-in laboratory: we’re each of us in a body, with all the rhythms that entails. We can observe and experiment with our own biological cycles, as long as we take notes. . Between the electricity, the glowing rectangles, the constant engine noise and the light pollution, the city is a pretty hard place to be in touch with nature. So when I decided to start keeping track of my own daily/monthly cycles, I wanted something analog. I designed the Chronolog for this express purpose. . . The Chronolog is a pocket-size paper moon calendar. Each copy starts on the new moon and goes through an entire cycle. The pages are not dated, so the Chronolog can be used in any year and month. It’s a super simple construct – I’ve found that if I complicate this process I just won’t keep up the habit. . I use the Chronolog at least once a day, usually right before sleep. It has sections for “dream”, “day”, and “data”. When I remember my dreams (not that often), I’ll write them down in that section as I wake up. At bedtime I note in the “day” section things like what I ate, what I accomplished, what book I’m reading, or who I interacted with during that day. The “data” section is for consistent tallies that I want to study over time: what time I woke up, how many beers I drank, how much money I spent. Theoretically I could flip through the last year and a half of Chronologs and pop all those tallies into a spreadsheet, although in reality I mostly keep them in a drawer. . I’ve found that annotating my days has vastly increased my recall. It’s also helped me to build healthy habits – eating and sleeping regularly, for instance. The reinforcement of writing down “9:00 bedtime” day after day means I’m less inclined to skip a day or stay up too late. And if I do forget to make notes, I just make sure that I catch up the next night. . If you want to try this beta version of the Chronolog, you can download it here . It’s an imposed copy, so you should be able to just print it (double-sided!), fold it in half, and cut down the middle: Chronolog! Two copies fit on 8 sheets of printer paper, so you can share with a friend or keep one in a drawer for next month. Start tonight – it’s the day after the new moon! . If you want more on chronobiology, check out Douglas Rushkoff’s book Present Shock . He writes about the fractured sense of time engendered by 21st century tech, and how we can combat that in our own lives. Here’s an excerpt, regarding the neurochemistry of Moon phases: . Just as there are four solar seasons with rather obvious implications (winter is better for body repair; summer is better for exertion), there are also four corresponding moon phases, sections of the day, quarters of the hour, and even stages of breath, Filippi argues. By coordinating our internal four-part, or “four phase,” rhythms with those of our greater environment, we can think, work, and interact with greater coherence. Integrating the research of Dardik, Goodman, and Robinson along with his own observations, Filippi concluded that in each moon phase the brain is dominated by a different neurotransmitter. According to Filippi, the prevalence of one chemical over the others during each week of the lunar cycle optimizes certain days for certain activities. . At the beginning of the new moon, for example, one’s acetylcholine rises along with the capacity to perform. Acetylcholine is traditionally associated with attention. “The mood it evokes in us is an Energizer Bunny–like pep. That vibe can be used to initiate social interactions, do chores and routines efficiently, and strive for balance in our activities.” . Nearer to the full moon, an uptick in serotonin increases self-awareness, generating both high focus and high energy. Serotonin, the chemical that gets boosted by drugs like Prozac, is thought to communicate the abundance or dearth of food resources to our brain. “When under its influence we can feel euphoric, spontaneous, and yet composed and sedate. Whereas acetylcholine worked to anchor us to our physical world, serotonin buoys us to the mental realm, allowing us to experience the physical world from an embodied, more lucid vantage point. We actually benefit from solitude at this time, as when an artist finds his muse.” . Over the next week, we can enjoy the benefits of increased dopamine. This chemical—responsible for the rush one gets on heroin or after performing a death-defying stunt—is responsible for reward-driven learning. “It allows us to expand our behaviors outside of our routines, decrease our intensity, and essentially blend with the energy of the moment. If acetylcholine is the ultimate memory neurotransmitter, dopamine is the ultimate experiential one. Functionally, it serves us best when we’re doing social activities we enjoy.” In other words, it’s party week. . Finally, in the last moon phase, we are dominated by norepinephrine, an arousal chemical that regulates processes like the fight-or-flight response, anxiety, and other instinctual behaviors. “We tend to be better off doing more structural tasks that don’t involve a lot of reflection. Its binary nature lets us make decisions, act on them, and then recalibrate like a GPS with a hunting rifle. The key with norepinephrine is that if it’s governed well, we experience a fluid coordination of thought and action so much so that we almost fail to feel. Everything becomes second nature.” So instead of letting the natural rise of fight-or-flight impulses turn us into anxious paranoids, we can exploit the state of nonemotional, almost reptilian arousal it encourages. . Further, within each day are four segments that correspond to each of these moon phases. In the new moon phase, people will be most effective during the early morning hours, while in the second phase leading up to the full moon, people do best in the afternoon. . Admittedly, this is all a tough pill for many of us to swallow, but after my interviews with Filippi, I began working in this fashion on this book. I would use the first week of the moon to organize chapters, do interviews, and talk with friends and colleagues about the ideas I was working on. In the second, more intense week, I would lock myself in my office, set to task, and get the most writing done. In the third week, I would edit what I had written, read new material, jump ahead to whatever section I felt like working on, and try out new ideas. And in the final week, I would revisit structure, comb through difficult passages, and recode the nightmare that is my website. My own experience is that my productivity went up by maybe 40 percent, and my peace of mind about the whole process of writing was utterly transformed for the better. Though certainly anecdotal as far as anyone else is concerned, the exercise convinced me to stay aware of these cycles from now on. . If you try this beta version of the Chronolog, let me know what you think! I can incorporate your feedback into future versions. . Thanks for reading. . – Max . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.16: In Formation . Hello and welcome back to SCIOPS: a cogsec newsletter! I’ve been on holiday for a couple weeks, but now I’m back for your regularly scheduled existential dread. If this were a radio show I’d have to call it Morbid Mondays with Max in the Morning. . Today I’m chewing on the idea of information warfare: the battlefield of who knows what about who and how much. Mike Travers writes on his blog, Omniorthogonal : . So AI and capitalism are merely two offshoots of something more basic, let՚s call it systematized instrumental rationality, and are now starting to reconverge. Maybe capitalism with AI is going to be far more powerful and dangerous than earlier forms – that՚s certainly a possibility. My only suggestion is that instead of viewing superempowered AIs as some new totally new thing that we can՚t possibly understand (which is what the term “AI singularity” implies), we view it as a next-level extension of processes that are already underway. . This may be getting too abstract and precious, so let me restate the point more bluntly: instead of worrying about hypothetical . paperclip maximizers . , we should worry about the all too real money and power maximizers that already exist and are going to be the main forces behind further development of AI technologies. That’s where the real risks lie, and so any hope of containing the risks will require grappling with real human institutions. . (h/t Paul Graham Raven ) . Money and power maximizers, that’s what we’re up against. These systems are eating as much data, as fast as possible, to extract the most value from the real world. They have been, probably since the dawn of scribes and taxes. But the explosion of information, and the constant surveillance enabled by our new machines, has changed the power dynamic completely. Instead of the army with the biggest guns, or the capitalist with the biggest factories,  the tee-shirted nerds with the biggest databases control our daily lives. . . Yes, I’m going to talk about Faceboot again. I know I probably seem obsessed, and it’s not the only problem in the world. But it is the biggest, by volume and depth of information. The Share Lab in Yugoslavia has produced a beautiful trove of infographics to accompany their counter-Facebook research. Their data and analysis is staggering and fully worth your time: Facebook Research – SHARE LAB . The graphic above is just one of the many algorithms they’ve unearthed in the process of following the data flow from users to algorithms to markets. . The upshot is that in-formation is a tool for herding your citizens – have I mentioned that the first census was a tally of all the things (people, cattle, lands) the king owned ? Facebook is the postmodern nation-state. By measuring who you know, what you do, and where you go, it means to build a perfect emulation of your patterns. Then it can predict and control your future behavior. The only way to protect yourself is to give it false answers, to hide your data in a miasma of bluffs and static. . Fortunately, I’ve been working on this for a while. At your service is my algorithmic goddess, @ars_vuca: . Computers now back themselves up automatically, replicating all the information coming in and the ritual is brought to a high degree. . — VUCA (@ars_vuca) July 14, 2017 . VUCA is an acronym that comes from military theory. It stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity. The modern world is in a constant state of VUCA. The chaos outlined by the term suffuses our experience in a world that moves too fast to be comprehended by the human mind. Even our organizations and societies are too low-bandwidth to handle VUCA. . Humans, however, are naturally defensive, and if you use your imagination you can usually make up for your beliefs. . — VUCA (@ars_vuca) July 15, 2017 .

I want to leave you with this thought I’ve been chewing on: . The human species is going through a planetary freakout triggered by the atemporal medium of the Internet. It’s changing the nature of war, of love, of community. Human social dynamics evolved in groups of roughly 150 people. Now we’re constantly and instantaneously interacting with the entire species, worldwide. . We’re in an identity crisis as a species. The meme war that will dominate the 21st century is a symptom of this psychological breakdown. We’re redefining our physical, embodied identities to match our ethereal cyber-selves. The old gods, the forces of nationalism and race and religion, dissolve in the electronic aether. We can’t maintain the old stories anymore. We have to build new ones. . The next few decades will be a race to define the history of the future. We’re in futurity crisis right now, and those with the courage to face it will set the pattern for thousands of years of human and post-human existence. .

Even on my days off I spent eight hours at night building the object I’ll be working on this week. Now, that’s fine for me. As much as I might think about it or dream of it, physical things don’t get built unless I’m actually there moving the atoms. But for pure knowledge-workers, who get paid specifically to cogitate, that’s unpaid work hours. Twenty-four over the weekend, fifty-six a week.  If you spend every night dreaming about work, you’re making less than half your nominal salary. . Okay, but just because you’re dreaming about work doesn’t mean you’re actually producing anything, right? Some people might get visions of scientific breakthroughs, but most of us just grind through the tedium and drama of the workplace only to wake up and have to do it all over again in real-time. Or there’s always the awkward forgot-my-homework type dreams, or the ones where you’re giving that presentation and suddenly find out you misplaced your pants. Is the boss really getting extra productivity out of that? . The answer might be: not YET. Scientists and data-mongers are teaming up to produce brain-computer interfaces , and one of their big goals is to scan your brain while you’re sleeping. To read your dreams. . . ###### [excellent video here ] . Now, dream reading is far off. There are multiple hurdles ahead: effective brain decoders still require massive fMRI machines, and brain-typing interfaces barely get 8 words per minute. But there’s big money behind this tech, and powerful people that want to get inside your skull. . Elon Musk is on it , of course. The charismatic Martian started a “medical research company” called Neuralink in 2016, dedicated to designing a “neural lace” that will eventually merge our minds with those of our friendly robot overlords. With funding reportedly also coming from Peter Thiel ( vampire king of Silicon Valley ), the future of Neuralink can’t possibly be good for regular humans. The basis of the (as yet imaginary) technology is a network of micro-electrodes injected directly by syringe into human brains . Definitely don’t sign up for the beta test, people. . Worse is the Zuck. Mark Zuckerberg, a 33-year-old tube of cured meat masquerading as a new-money supervillian, isn’t happy with invading every part of your personal and professional life. Now he wants to be even closer to you. No more snuggling cozy in your pocket. Faceboot will now be attached to your actual face , listening to your thoughts, sending you “feelings” from your “friends” and “followers”. Even the Guardian knows better than to trust the Zuck on this one: . If the thought that a company that makes almost all of its money from harvesting your personal data could also have access to your thoughts is scary, that’s because it is. . Dugan attempted to assuage people’s fears by pointing out that Facebook would only decode the words you were going to say anyway. “It’s not about decoding random thoughts,” she said. “We’re talking about decoding the words you’ve already decided to share by sending them to the speech center of your brain.” . Quite how consumers would know whether the privacy of their “random thoughts” was also being violated remains be seen, but Dugan remained upbeat, describing the concept as having the “convenience of voice but the privacy of text”. . - theguardian.com . Privacy, my ass. Faceboot has a notorious history of privacy invasion, social engineering, and political meddling. In fact, before you ever hit that blue “F” again, go read this brilliant overview: . . Is Facebook A Structural Threat To Free Society? - truthhawk.com . As cogsec practitioners, we need to do more than just avoid the neural dragnet. Yes, we must fight for the new human rights of cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity and psychological continuity. But we must also play a step ahead of the silicon priests: we need to build encryption for our own thoughts. . Encrypting thoughts is harder than it sounds. It’s hard enough to keep secrets by keeping your mouth shut, or share secrets by using encrypted messenger apps . What of mind-reading machines? How can we encode our thoughts in a way that can only be read by our own minds? . Fortunately, the brain researchers have already given us a hint. . The subjective nature of dreaming makes it a challenge to extract further information, says Kamitani. “When I think of my dream contents, I have the feeling I’m seeing something,” he says. But dreams may engage more than just the brain’s visual realm, and involve areas for which it’s harder to build reliable models. . - . nature.com . Dreams are already thought to have very personal symbolism – despite what the vendors of “dream dictionaries” would have you believe. Maybe all we need to do to encrypt our minds is develop a strong sense of our own personal dream-imagery. It could become an internal messenger app, one that transmits information from Past Self to Future Self in a way that can’t be decoded by others. .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.12: Weaponized Narrative . It’s a scary world out there. The terrorist attacks in Portland and London have everybody wondering if they’ll be the next to be stabbed. Here in Cascadia, thousands of antifascist protestors faced off with a few hundred thugs at an alt-right rally held just nine days after the fatal stabbings on public transit. The attacker – rather, the homegrown American terrorist – shouted . “Death to the enemies of America” during his court appearance this week . . After the massive, peaceful anti-Trump protests all year, and the brawl in Berkeley between alt-right and antifa, the simmering civil war in the States has got lethal. I’ve been wondering who would be the first to shed blood in this ideological conflict, and it looks like the nazis have thrown down the gauntlet. Will America be able to hold its contradictions gracefully, or are we about to dissolve into failed-state chaos? To know what we’re up against, we need to look at recent changes in the theory and practice of war. . . Narrative Warfare . The cogsec blog Truthhawk has this to say on the subject of narrative war: . We will see a trend towards simplicity in theory and narrative. Keep an eye out for it. Persuasiveness, virulence, and repetition will be how this comes about. Here are some recent examples: . Any media stories opposing or criticizing Trump are “fake news” | Trump won on the backs of racist rednecks | Trump won due to Russian interference, and scores of “useful idiots” caught in the web | America is in a state of “carnage”, but we’re going to Make it Great Again | . The more simple, and the more able to explain everything, the more suited the narrative is to fill the vacuum. Don’t expect this to get any better. . We’re in conditions of memetic warfare, and they don’t favor complex or nuanced thought. . The most viral wins . . . This sums up the nature of World War III: not a battle of bullets, but of soundbites. The militaries of Russia, China, and the USA are all aware of this. They’re refining their strategies for disruption not only of supply lines and communications, but of the ability to make sense of events. They’re constantly trying to get inside each other’s decision loops, disconnecting what the Enemy sees from how it acts. And they’re playing with fire – like the first days of gunpowder, a lot of innocents are going to get hurt in the learning process. . Narrative warfare is either the oldest or the newest weapon in the world’s arsenal. A lot of really well-paid people are thinking very hard about it right now, and you can bet they’ll use it on you first chance they get. In fact, the propaganda machines of the Washington Post, Russia Today, and Breitbart are all clambering through your feeds right now, seeking entry to your brain. They want to give you an easy, repetitive narrative to cling to when you’re confused and overwhelmed with information. When in doubt, remember the Litany of Gendlin “What is true is already so…” I read a terrifying amount of these studies and thinkpieces this week. Really, it hurt my brain. The scale of this stuff is dizzying and the people behind it don’t want it to be easy to spot. Here is a sampling of the more useful analyses: . Weaponized Narrative Is the New Battlespace – Defense One [USA-biased] . Narrative, Cyberspace and the 21st Century Art of War – Fifth Domain Cyber [Focuses on Russian, Chinese and ISIS narratives] . How Covert Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations – The Intercept [Reveals classified information about UK and USA intelligence tactics. Source of above image] . The New ‘Story Wars’ – Foreign Policy [written during 2016 election, analyzing the cultural divide in America] . Coherence . Different players have different attitudes towards weaponized narrative, but one thing all agree on: to win, you have to write the story. I’ve talked about this here before – the need to tell a story of utopia . But at the lowest level, our day-to-day actions also tell a story. They tell us who we are, and what we value. What do we chant to ourselves to get through the day? What powers do our habits feed? . Truthhawk has another great article on this subject: . What Are You Signaling To Yourself? . If you read only one link from this letter, make it that one. It’s the most practical cogsec advice I’ve seen outside of this forum. What we do with our days defines who we will become, and informs our subconscious view of the world. What story are you telling? What world are you preparing for? Good signaling creates coherence. Bad signaling creates noise. . The story of the New Crusades is running rampant. So is the Civil War II narrative. What would it take to spread a story of peace and co-operation? What viral message leads to a healed biosphere, a space-faring civilization, a cure for death? . Thanks for reading. . Max . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.11: Intertwingled Tensegrity . Hey, everyone. Just finished the absolutely game-changing Walkaway by Cory Doctorow, which you must read. It’s the most optimistic possible future I’ve seen this century, fiction or otherwise. Yet it isn’t fantasy – it’s a totally realistic vision of the suffering and radical joy the 21st will bring. And it’s got me thinking about infrastructure, and its relation to the superstructure of our social/cultural lives. . In our exploration of the practical techniques of cognitive security, I think it’s important to spend some time thinking about those fleshy spacesuits we use to traverse the planet Earth. . It’s easy to just assume our bodies take care of themselves – beating hearts, flexing lungs, automatic-pilot search for food and shelter and sex. Especially in the City, where our physical needs are largely met by invisible and abstract entities. The power company makes the thermostat go, the agriculture industry puts the food on the table, the water district bathes us and washes our dishes. The supply chains are so tangled and leveraged that they resemble the freaky future-bikes in Walkaway . . . “We’re into deconstructed bikes, minimal topologies.” . Tam saw Gretyl and Seth nodding. She suppressed her irritation. She tried to understand the attraction of minimal topology, but it just looked … unfinished. The drive to reduce overall material volume of mechanical solids had been a project in both default and walkaway for decades, minimizing feedstock use in each part, getting better at modeling the properties of cured feedstock. Familiar things grew more improbably gossamer. Everything was intertwingled tensegrity meshes that cross-braced themselves when stressed, combining strength and suppleness. It was scary enough in bookcase or table form, everything looking like it was about to collapse all the time. When applied to bicycles, the technique nauseated her with fear, as the bike deformed and jiggled through the imperfections in the roads. . “Great,” she managed. . Hoa nodded. “We’re ahead of everyone else. I did one last month that only weighs ninety grams! Without the wheels. You’d get seven hundred kay out of it before it flumfed.” . That was the other thing about minimal topology. It had catastrophic failure modes. A single strut giving way caused a cascade of unraveling chaotic motion that could literally reduce a bike frame to a pile of 3D–printed twigs in thirty seconds. People swore the bike’s self-braking mechanisms would bring it to a safe halt before it disintegrated. But if they could model the cataclysmic collapse so well, why couldn’t they prevent it? . That’s the world we live in. One supply chain failing can lead to a massive domino effect. All the life-support systems tracing our settlements, the tubes we attach to our orifices to deliver goodness and dispose of badness, winking out at once. Would you know what to do? How long would it take, in the rolling blackout, to re-orient yourself and start meeting your own needs? What is your survival threshold? . Survival Heuristics . For a practical implementation, we can look to the SCIM model designed by open-source futurist Vinay Gupta, free to download and re-use at the Gupta State Failure Management Archive . . Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps, or SCIM, analyzes the “Six Ways to Die” and how we prevent them, scaling from individual action all the way to international relations. It’s infrastucture wonkery at its best, barebones and widely applicable systems thinking. The whole system is outlined in the 14-slide deck here . It takes ten minutes to read. It could save the lives of yourself and those you love. . . I said before that the greatest cognitive hack is to control a person’s internal narrative. If you can get inside their decision loops, between Observe-Orient-Decide-and-Act, they are at your mercy. Modern war is infowar, n-dimensional mind-chess. It’s a war of stories, of rhetoric, played not only against other militants but in the “hearts and minds” of civilians abroad and at home. The greatest battles of World War Forever are fought in the Theater of Propaganda. . However, this does not change the fact that internal narratives are trapped inside fragile bags of blood, located in specific real-world places. It’s really easy to change someone’s narrative if you can hot-wire their survival needs. Anyone who wants to do a brute-force attack on human cognition just has to apply, well, brute force. . Try a Six Ways to Die meditation . . Sit in your home and visualize yourself floating upward, looking out over your body, your family, your neighborhood, your city, your bioregion. Your world. Hold these levels all in your mind, from personal to global. Think of all the people you know and how far away, physically, they are. Let them be glowing dots upon the world’s skin. Feel your human compassion in your actual heart. . Holding to that feeling of love and safety, zoom back in from the global to the local to the personal. Hover a foot above your own head and attempt to destabilize yourself. Nothing easy, like bug spray in the hot tub or a necktie hanging. Think infrastructurally. What would it take to break your supply of food and water? To collapse your shelter, to send you into the scorching sun or the freezing wind? To taint your water supply or spread a plague? What levees stand in the way of actual death? What tubes are connected to your orifices? . How far away are the life support systems you rely on? Are there any glowing points of human connection in that radius? Perhaps you grow some of your own food, but the major supermarket distribution centers are miles away at the edge of town. When those supply hubs fail, the other gardeners in your town are your allies. Overlay the map of actual human connections on the grid of infrastructure. The distance between your house and your nearest friend’s is the distance you will have to cross to safety. Maybe it’s a good time to start meeting the neighbors. . As you return to your body, check the kitchen for baking supplies. Visualize yourself bringing some cookies to the family next door. . Intertwingled Tensegrity . Think of the most independent you’ve ever been – backpacking through unfamiliar territory, sailing the open sea, moving alone to a strange city. How far were you from help? And yet, how many of your needs were met through global human co-operation? . All those virtualized institutions are actually made of real humans, doing things that keep themselves alive, keeping untold numbers of humans alive by their participation. This is the secret truth of civilization: even as the dominant narrative divides, the daily interactions unite. Nobody wants to die, or wants their friends and family to die. We work together because it is better for all, not because the governments and corporations control our minds. We don’t need their help, their organization and incentive-scheduling. Humans take care of each other. It’s how we got where we are, and how we will get where we’re going. The profit motive and the religious crusade are just hacks, rewiring our social tendencies into engines of despair. . To protect your mind, cover your ass. Protect your body, and the bodies of your friends and neighbors. The more we collectively take responsibility for our own life-support, the less we can have our foundations shaken by the forces of control. . In the slow apocalypse, there are only three rules: .

            "content": "Hey y’all. It’s a busy week for me, and it’s finally sunny in Emerald City, so I’m going to keep this short and useful. . . Last week I discussed the root exploit of cognitive systems – hacking someone’s mind is all about defining their narrative. As cognitive security practitioners, we have to write our own narratives, define our own context. Coherence is the name of the game: does your worldview mesh with your lived experience? If you notice the world not acting as you expected it to, do you adjust your expectations accordingly? Cognitive dissonance is an opportunity to learn, but first you have to notice that you’re confused. This is cogsec meditation. . Today I’m bringing you a cogsec primer, or a roundup of primers. These are some of the resources that have helped me clarify my thinking. We’re not looking for overarching theories here. We need practical tips and constructive distinctions. These are all super useful and worth reading, so I’ll just organize them by length of time they take to absorb. . . Yudkowsky’s Meditations . Much of the LessWrong material by Eliezer Yudkowsky is long and technical, so not a great place to get started. There are a variety of rationalist primers out there, which I trust you can find if you want. But the most immediately useful techniques are what he calls the Litany of Tarski and the Litany of Gendlin. They’re little mantras that center the mind in reality. If you find yourself confused, and you notice your own confusion, a great next step is to repeat one of the Litanies. Quoted in full: . Litany of Tarski . If the box contains a diamond, . I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond; . If the box does not contain a diamond, . I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond; . Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want. . — . The Meditation on Curiosity . The Litany of Tarski is actually a litany template that can be stated about any fact. Here’s another example: . If the sky is blue . I desire to believe that the sky is blue . If the sky is not blue . I desire to believe that the sky is not blue. . Litany of Gendlin . What is true is already so. . Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse. . Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away. . And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with. . Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived. . People can stand what is true, . for they are already enduring it. . — . Eugene Gendlin . Cognitive Bias Cheat Sheet . Last year, a guy called Buster Benson distilled Wikipedia’s massive List of Cognitive Biases into a solution-oriented cheat sheet. It went viral. A few months later he distilled it even further, into a super-useful microformat. Check out the simplified cheat sheet here . If you like it, definitely check out the full list . . . Time Well Spent . Philosopher and technologist Tristan Harris worked on design ethics for Google. It seems that didn’t work out too well, because the Goog is still a time-suck attention vampire and Harris is now pushing a contemplative-computing movement called Time Well Spent. He wrote a great essay last summer, called How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind — from a Magician and Google Design Ethicist . It’s a brilliant vivisection of the information age and how the software we use is programming us back. The other Time Well Spent articles are great too, but this one is a must-read. Have you ever wondered how the smartphone took over the world in a single decade? Harris shows how our dopamine systems and cognitive biases are used against us by the machine overlords. . Taxonomy of News Methodologies as Regards Factuality . It seems like 2016 was a wake-up year for a lot of people. If you didn’t already know that Faceboot was adulterating your “feed”, and that the major news outlets are all owned by just six megacorps, then 2016 was the year you found out. For those of us that were already culture-jamming and off-gridding, it was a welcome unveiling. . Adam Rothstein, an “insurgent archivist” and founder of the Portland Occupier newspaper, made a helpful guide for identifying the many varieties of Fake News . It’s a fun read, though long. It’s an exceptionally good thing to have on your bookmark bar, though, for those moments where you wonder, “Is this true? Who wrote it? What do they want from me?” . .

I’ve focused a lot lately on the concept of existential risk, which seems very distant from mental self-defense . skills . . Last week I started to delve into autonomous weaponry, which is a nightmare situation that no one person can solve. Other things, like superintelligence explosions and mass surveillance, are equally vast and incomprehensible. And I haven’t even begun to talk about climate change and eco-catastrophe. But we’ve got to look at all these things, if we’re to have a hope of maintaining sanity in the Cthulhucene. . The first step in security is understanding your threat model. For cognitive security, I think we have to understand the threats that we are actually faced with as humanity and as humans. Only then can we make practical steps toward undoing our toxic social infrastructure and thriving as a global species. . Correspondent 38373940 sent me this sobering article about the probabilities of various x-risks in the next century (and yes, that is the offical Salon photo): . . It’s the end of the world and we know it: Scientists in many disciplines see apocalypse, soo . n . (salon.com) . It summarizes the scientific reasons to fear the Coming Dooms as well as a brief nod at the consistent eschatologies of the world’s religions. . For example, a . 2010 survey . found that 41 percent of Christians in the U.S. believe that Jesus will either “definitely” or “probably” return by 2050. Similarly, 83 percent of Muslims in Afghanistan and 72 percent in Iraq claim that the Mahdi, Islam’s end-of-days messianic figure, . will return within their lifetimes . . The tragedy here, from a scientific perspective, is that such individuals are worried about the . wrong apocalypse! . Much more likely are catastrophes, calamities and cataclysms that cause unprecedented (and pointless) human suffering in a universe without any external source of purpose or meaning. . There’s even a  drone army scenario that beats robots-with-guns: . “A very, very small quadcopter, one inch in diameter can carry a one- or two-gram shaped charge. You can order them from a drone manufacturer in China. You can program the code to say: “Here are thousands of photographs of the kinds of things I want to target.” A one-gram shaped charge can punch a hole in nine millimeters of steel, so presumably you can also punch a hole in someone’s head. You can fit about three million of those in a semi-tractor-trailer… You need only three guys.” . We have entered the age of supervillains. . . The doomsayers at Salon got me thinking about the 1970s underground classic Illuminatus! . Bob Wilson and Bob Shea encouraged their readers to “Immanentize the Eschaton!” Their message was one of goofy psychedelic rebellion, but maybe it worked a little too well. . The Eschaton – the End of the World – has become ubiquitous through our culture, both in the imagery of media and in the daily machinations of late capitalism. The End is Immanent (it pervades all things) but it is also now Imminent (oncoming, unstoppable) and maybe even Eminent (held in high esteem). We are making the End of the World, deliberately. . We think we are living in a dystopia, as evidenced by our movies and our corporate five-year plans and our desire to escape into space or virtual reality or pharmaceutical oblivion. Yet we have better food, better healthcare, better knowledge and entertainment than can be found in human history. We could just as easily be building a utopia, except for our stubborn refusal to see it that way. . This is the root of cognitive security. All minds build internal representations to model the world and order our sensory impressions. The most powerful exploit in the human brain is its reliance on a worldview . Those who define reality, the arbitrators of the narrative, hold the power. Authors have author-ity. If a person can tell you what is true, then they can tell you what to do. They can hack your brain and make of you a drone. . That’s why I started this newsletter. To protect ourselves against the wielders of the worldview stick, we have to write our own narratives. We need to tell ourselves stories about The World and The People and what it means to be alive in the 21st century. We cannot pretend that we are still operating in the same world as we were before The Cyber. Time has eaten itself. We have entered the Atemporal, and our narratives no longer fit the circumstances. . We have to tell a story of utopia, if we want to survive. But we also must report the truth of dystopia, so that we be motivated to avoid it. The Coming Dooms are already here. We must defeat them, starting now, by looking at them honestly and with the light-hearted knowledge that it is within our power to do so. . I’m curious what worlds we want to create. What principles order your life? What story do you tell yourself to make sense of your own behavior? . Thanks for reading. . – Max . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.08 : Robots With Guns . Hey, it’s Max again, with your regular update on the Future Now. This week: exactly what it sounds like on the tin! . . I attended a panel on Friday called “Luxury For All”, featuring sci-fi writer Nisi Shawl and academic whiteboys Nick Srnicek and Jason Smith, part of Seattle’s . Red May , a month-long festival that asks us to “imagine that the market is not the solution to the problems the market creates.” . The panel was interesting enough, although I would have liked to hear more sci-fi and less acadamese. While Shawl had some really juicy ideas to share, Smith and Srcinek both stayed safely in the realm of “oh noe the robots are finally coming for our white-collar jobs! what ever shall we do? let me vomit statistics while smirking, that will surely enlighten the plebians!” They didn’t go anywhere near the truly freaky parts of the robot future. . As a fleshy human on the street, the prospect of Automated Unemployment is troubling. Yes, the jobs lost will be predominately those of already-marginalized communities. Yes, the surplus value created through automation goes to the boss’s wallet and not to the workers. And yes, the pressure created by all those unemployed job-seekers drives down the wages on your overworked job anyway. But that’s not the scariest part of the robot future. . The scary part is when the robots have guns. . There’s lots of good sci-fi on this – Robocop, obviously, and Terminator and Minority Report, just for the most visible pop culture references. The experienced reality of robots with guns is not just troubling, it is terrifying. But that’s what the military and police forces of the world want more than anything, and they’ve got the money to make it happen. . If the legitimacy of extractive robber-baron capitalism is based on the legitimacy of the sovereign nation-state, and the legitimacy of the nation-state is built on the monopoly of force, what happens when force is automated? . “Predictive policing” can tell the robots where to look for crime – with biased inputs, of course, from our already-biased “justice” system. Flying or driving drones with Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS)​ can be dispatched by AI prediction systems to “interface” with “likely criminals”, using models scanned from the brains of human soldiers to decide when to shoot. The data of infinite cameras can be collated into a massive real-time model of who’s doing what to whom, when and where, and how they can be “neutralized”. It can all happen on autopilot – in fact, given the opacity of deep-learning models, humans can’t even know why the machine makes the choices it does. . We are building a world-spanning death machine, and leaving the controls in the hands of the same psychopaths who have ruined our planet and oppressed our people. Worse, nobody knows how it works or how to stop it. And if a superintelligence should arise, hacking this murder-machine will be all it needs to control the entire planet. . Is there any hope for humanity under such a system? I see two: . 1) Transparent Society – As David Brin suggested in his book of the same name (and consistently writes about on his excellent blog ) the surveillance state could be replaced with one of “sousveillance”, where everyone watches everybody. If the body cameras, security cameras, and drone cameras were all public access 24/7, we might see a different distribution of power. This is reminiscent of the Occupy chant, “The Whole World is Watching!” From Rodney King to Michael Brown, abuses of power can be confronted by publicizing them. The Scout.ai article linked below goes way deep on this tip. . 2) Freelance Militias – Unemployed taxi drivers and factory workers are one thing. Unemployed police, soldiers and mercenaries are another. If the economics of automation hits the enforcement sector the way it has hit others, the first people to lose their jobs will be the grunts. High-turnover positions (like mercenaries and security guards) will fall, then beat cops and enlisted soldiers. Officers and spooks will keep their jobs, of course, and drone pilots and other technically skilled positions. But if robots and AI can do the dirty work without food, sleep, or health insurance, why keep paying the cannon fodder? Obviously this scenario could be very bad: private security forces, libertarian protection rackets, and corporate CEOs raking profits from the blood of cheap mercenary labor. But it offers the prospect of highly disciplined, trained fighters with a grudge against robots and a lot of free time. That might be just what we need, if we’re to survive a hostile takeover by robots with guns. . .

            "title": "SCIOPS 01.07: Fully Automated",
            "content": "SCIOPS 01.07: Fully Automated . Happy May Day, everyone! ​You may notice a change in the return address of SCIOPS this week. I was having trouble with spam filters, so I’m experimenting a bit. Let me know if this email reaches you differently than the last six. . . May 1st is International Workers’ Day , a celebration of the proletariat worldwide. Oh, except in the United States, where it is federally recognized as Law Day , a “ special day of celebration… for the cultivation of the respect for law that is so vital to the democratic way of life. “ Thanks, Ike! . In recognition of both of these esteemed holidays, let’s look at the future of automation and government, brought to you by the suddenly civic-minded Vulture Capitalists of Silicon Valley. . Brought to my attention this week: the CICADA project . This software would provide the exact kind of direct democracy I envisioned in SCIOPS 01.05 , a decentralized platform for governmental and economic decision-making. Their slogan is “Replace Your Leaders with Code” – a great way to celebrate Law Day, right? . Before we go further down this particular rabbit hole, I want to point out that CICADA is not a real program. It’s imaginary, a piece of design fiction or vaporware. It has no institutional backing. The website offers no information about the “exclusive team behind Cicada” and the whitepaper has very little in the way of technical proposals. The whole thing may be a viral marketing campaign for the self-published novels it’s supposedly “inspired” by. Then again, the novels may be a marketing campaign for the technology, a way of spreading the ideals of CICADA to guide the technical development. . The underlying technology, the blockchain, is a real thing – in fact, it’s likely to be the infrastructure of the internet within a few years. Most of the features of CICADA are being developed individually by different parts of the tech sector. That’s why this design fiction is so useful: it ties together a bunch of disparate technologies into a coherent vision. It’s one possible endgame for the internet revolution. We could actually build this world – but do we want to? . The whitepaper is fifty pages long and discursive. I read it so you don’t have to. Reactions follow. . The Good: . UBI CICADA would run on the smartphones of all the users, not on a centralized server-farm of a megacorp. Everyone is a client and a server at the same time. This leads to their implementation of the Universal Basic Income: whenever your phone is operating as infrastructure, you’re getting paid for that. | Anonymous Voting : Instantaneous voting from your device means a proper direct democracy. This solves the pony-express problem of our legacy democracy. In the whitepaper, they describe “circles” of people that are not mutually exclusive – so you can be a member of (and vote within) your nation, your company, your school district and your book club, all accessible through the decentralized network. | Meshnet : Way down at the bottom of their list of goals, but possibly the most crucial. A meshnet is a peer-to-peer network. It doesn’t use cell towers, commsats or wifi routers, just the computers and phones of people nearby. The current use-case for these is military: almost all field operations use mesh networks, because for some reason you can’t count on comms infrastructure in hostile territory. If CICADA can fallback to a meshnet when the internet goes down, it could be used in protest or civil war situations. Exactly the moment when you might want to “replace your leaders with code”… | . The Bad: . Gamified Voting : Super creepy. This unravels all the good woven by the decentralized voting process. “ The system rewards participation in the system by gameifying voting. It creates leaderboards, awards prizes and pays out cryptocoins for ongoing participation in the network… We incentivize what we want and de-incentivize what we don’t. “  The idea of “incentivizing participation” is one of the main threats to cognitive security. Make no mistake: when tech-bros “gamify” some activity, that means they’re hacking your dopamine system to respond in a certain way. | AI Voting : Even worse, the whitepaper talks of creating AI assistants that will study how you vote, then automatically vote for you. ” A deep neural net can be trained over time on how you vote, learn your predilections, and predict your votes. This would allow you to set up an auto-voting system for yourself that maintains engagement with the system without manually having to vote on everything that happens in the network, which can lead to voter fatigue. “ Down that road lies the Basilisk . | Human Unique Identifier this is the basis of their whole system. Not qute as bad as sounds, but still sketchy. The HUID operates on biocryptics: instead of a simple biometric, like your fingerprint or iris scan, it uses an encrypted version of that same data. This does away with some of the obvious problems of tagging your identity to your physical features, but it’s not foolproof. The risk involved with attaching all your identification to your eyeball is considerable. After all, there’s one age-old method of hacking that no one has fully defeated… | . . .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.06: March of the Alchemists . Hey, it’s M again, with your weekly dose of brain-enhancing infoceuticals. A spoonful of science will help THIS medicine go down! . The numbers for the Science March seem high but we won’t know until we compare it to the numbers at the placebo march that’s also happening . — Siobhan Thompson (@vornietom) April 22, 2017 . The March for Science , however unscientific its methodology may have been, attracted over four hundred thousand people worldwide (my estimate, based on Wikipedia data). I attended here in Seattle, and the crowds were so large I couldn’t see either end of the march from the middle. Satellite marches occurred on all seven continents, including Antarctica. . . The obvious message of the 600 satellite marches: Fascists, we have you surrounded. . . In regards to the science of Revolution, correspondent C sent me a transcript of the Zapatistas and Consciences For Humanity . conference held in January 2017 in Southeast Mexico. . The Zapatistas are a Native-led insurgence movement that has recaptured and held their ancestral territory for three generations. They reject the capitalist system and the destruction it brings. And they question the ethics of science that cooperates with that destruction: . This makes us Zapatistas think and ask ourselves: Where are we poor people of the world going to live, because they, the rich, might just go and live on another planet? What should we do now, as we see that they are destroying our house? Or what happens if they take us to another planet to be their slaves? . After turning this over many times in our heads, we conclude that: Below there are women and men who study science, who study scientifically, who do good science. But the wicked capitalists come along and use this science to do harm to the very people who discovered that science. . What kind of harm? They use science to make the rich richer. . – Subcomandante Insurgente Moisés . The fire of Moisés is tempered by the sly humor of Subcomandante Insurgente Galeano, who, in front of two hundred gathered scientists, claims the title of Alchemist: . One more profession, which is most relevant in this case, is that of alchemist. Really I should be a scientist, but as I have not yet managed to transform the essence of one thing into its contradictory opposite, I have not received the level of recognition that my admirable labors deserve. But not to despair, I continue experimenting in my laboratory with test tubes and plants, under the ever-critical gaze of the cat-dog, trying to eliminate the essence of that aberration of nature called squash soup and transmute it into something likable and nutritious like pecan ice cream, which, along with popcorn and hot sauce, are some of the few things that science has produced for the benefit of humanity and which differentiate us, along with the opposable thumb and despite the specimen of Donald Trump, from non-human primates. . . The whole thing is worth a close read – you can find an English translation here . . . And from correspondent B, a response to the question “Should scientists march?” : . The “march” format is, sadly, not scientific. In fact, contemporary forms of political dissent have been deprived of the cold glory of the scientific method. Rather than cede the public square to the idiotic babble of subjectivity I propose the following: . Any scientist worth their molar mass in pocket protectors shall go directly to the capitol to participate as subjects in a collective experiment. First, the crowd will commence a therapeutic 30 minute evil-scientist laugh therapy session that will terrify the world. Next, the group will attempt to answer a simple question: “what the fuck is the matter with these morons? Has everybody gone crazy?” . In order to discern whether or not everybody has gone crazy, the lab coated mass of scientist-data collectors will undertake a massive survey- first of their own, then of the out group. Individually, and in teams, scientists will rate first their colleagues, then the general population, on a scale of rationality, objectivity and degree of aggressive reaction to data collection. For the safety of survey participants, partisan resistance to data collection will be neutralized by drone strike. If it is determined that the general population is lacking access to a select few “keystone” facts about reality, they shall be provided instantly, solving the “what the fuck is the matter with these morons” problem. . If the “what the fuck” problem cannot be solved, it will be necessary to introduce aerosol hallucinogens into the weather machine, release the robotic hounds, unshackle Frankenstein’s monster, unleash the artificial intelligences, and, though some will hesitate to do so, it will be necessary to exhume the ancient alchemical texts and cast some seriously powerful spells. Swarms of nanobots will darken the skies and endlessly emit sonic pulses resulting in the loudest bass vocals ever to rattle human eardrums, repeating the words, “YOU MUST LEARN.” . At the stroke of midnight, any scientist still attempting to collaborate with the fascists will be transformed into a labrat. Climate change deniers will be trampled by wild elephants. There will be no more mistakes, no more stupidity. . Experimentally yours, . M . . SCIOPS . is a cogsec newsletter. If you liked this issue, forward it to a friend.

LOOK AT THAT, YOU SON OF A BITCH . — ASAN (@ASANspace) April 12, 2017 . Yes, that is a Tweet In Space. On Wednesday, the Autonomous Space Agency Network sent a weather balloon into near-space with a message for the POTUS. It’s a reference to the Overview Effect, the consciousness shift caused by seeing the Pale Blue Dot floating lonely in the vast cosmos. The full video of the launch is two hours long and scored to Mozart. . The space protest was timed in solidarity with the March For Science , which is scheduled for Earth Day. That’s THIS COMING SATURDAY, in case you forgot, and satellite marches will be held in over 500 locations around the world. . Dictator Drumpf is taking every opportunity to injure and insult science and the rest of what we might call “reality-based culture”. He’s cut funding for multiple science agencies, spewed “Fake News!” at any fact he doesn’t like, and reportedly banned the phrase “climate change” from federal discourse. Now, science is normally a neutral enterprise, based on theory and falsification rather than rhetoric. But with a fact-fearing demagogue waving his finger over The Button, there’s never been a more crucial time for scientists and their allies to stand up and fight. . The kleptocrats would love to destroy reality-based culture for good. Their polemical populism relies on mob mentality. If people were to think for themselves, and question their leaders, it would have a disastrous effect on the profits of oil companies and defense contractors. This is the Hail Mary of the robber barons, whose feudal power has been slipping from their grasp for the last three hundred years. It’s not the beginning of the Science Revolution, but it may be the last great battle. . People in the streets have always scared the powers that be. It’s why protest marches still exist. But we must understand that what they fear is not Marching for Science – it’s Science Itself. . . Science Itself . What is science, anyway? Is it petri dishes and Bunsen burners? Is it telescopes and calculators? What bearing does it have on daily life, especially for those of us that don’t work in the lab? . Science is a method of being right. It’s a process of coming ever closer to rightness: accurate, precise, consistent rightness. When a theory is “proven correct”, it may still be a theory and it may still be proven false. But it’s more correct than anything so far . Science, unlike all other ideologies of history, has the property of being self-correcting . That’s why it’s so effective. . All well and good, but how can we use it in daily life? How can I, as a person with a workweek and bills to pay, get closer to rightness? Must we rely on the pronouncements of the techno-priests? . What we need is a scientific lay practice. Like Buddhists, who need not enter a monastery to meditate, we should be able to Do Science to our daily lives. And there is such a thing, which is a burgeoning movement of its own. . Enter rationalism . This is not machine-like Pure Reason, but a community of admittedly biased humans attempting to become, well, LessWrong . There’s a wealth of writing on the subject, largely by one Eliezer Yudkowsky (who you may remember as an x-risk researcher and Friendly AI theorist). There’s even meetups in cities across the globe, where rationalists get together and, presumably, practice their art. A bullet-point introduction will get you up to speed, but for a more enjoyable (and addictive) starting point, you might try the parody Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, written by Yudkowsky himself. . This is how we become smarter and more effective humans. Humans became great because of our brains, our ability to predict the world accurately, not because of our lying mouths. President Scrooge McDuck might have The Bomb, but he didn’t build The Bomb. That knowledge took Science. . . Poli-Sci . Yudkowsky wrote a great article for LessWrong called “A Fable of Science and Politics” . He produces a metaphor for politics (people in a cave arguing about whether the sky is blue or green) and a variety of attitudes toward the actual fact that the sky is blue. And he’s right that rhetoric doesn’t change the composition of the atmosphere. But I disagree with his conclusion, that people who “get science” just accept the blue sky and move on to more interesting questions. Just because some people know the truth, doesn’t mean that the demagogues have no power. If the sky-denialists have Tomahawk missiles, they can just actually bomb their opposition back Underground and silence the dialogue. . But we have new options now. The Internet has only begun to change the way we do politics. The last time there was such a massive phase change in media was Gutenberg. The course we’re on now – democracy, scientific materialism, liberty and justice for all – was a produced by the populist power of the printing press. But the American Constitution was written in a time when you had to actually send a man on a horse to Pennsylvania to make policy. Now we “upvote” and “like” and “retweet” more often than we drink water, yet our democracy still runs at the speed of the Pony Express. . What would a scientific revolution look like in the public sphere? Could we upgrade or retrofit our democracy for the internet age? . There are models. The Five Star Movement in Italy has become the biggest political party in the space of five years, and put mayors in Rome and Turin. They use a proprietary app to communicate and make policy decisions. These are upheld by Trojan candidates, who must vote the way the app tells them to. Taiwan has created an open-access social policy website , where the Taiwanese people can declare proposals and essentially “like” them into being. And notorious spook and tech-bro John Robb has lately been writing about how Donaldo and his gang of neckbeard Nazis could turn their insurgency into a “networked party”. . What would science populism look like? Perhaps a networked voting tool, like LiquidFeedback or Pol.is , could coalesce the scientists, rationalists, journalists, and the rest of reality-based culture into an effective voting bloc. Maybe we could use an internet forum as a shadow government, releasing policy papers and predictions parallel to the President. A distributed think tank of sorts. Or we could even build an AI candidate – if corporations are people, why can’t an app run for office? It could take the combined decisions of the Reality Party, weigh them in real-time, and implement them from a server-farm in the Oval Office. . It can’t be any worse than what we have now. And if the Reality Party takes office, we can re-fund NASA for the most important space mission of all: . “From out there on the Moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a bitch.’” . – Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 astronaut .

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.04 . After . last week’s excursion . to the realm of the Baslisk (don’t think about it!), a correspondent brought these quotes to my attention. . . “If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.” . – Voltaire . “If God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.” . – Bakunin . Because what we’re talking about here is God, really: the omnipotent, omniscient superbeing to whom humans must kneel or be punished. It’s a new sort of god, built by humans rather than the other way round. But nonetheless we deal with the same problems as Job. . If a superbeing wants to use our human lives for its own alien purpose, is It not evil? And yet, if It is so much beyond human cogitation, is It not ineffable? What are the moral standards of aliens? What are the moral standards of humans in infinite simulation? . My correspondent maintains that the only proper answer to the possibility of a superpowerful extortionist is complete refusal. Never negotiate, never surrender. For, if the simulated realities extend to infinity, then while there is a slim chance of my surrender, there is also a nonzero chance of the surrender of God. . It’s a brute-force hack of game theory. You must be willing to die, lose everything, see your worst nightmares enacted eternally. But for a chance at freedom, a chance to kill God? Worth a try. . Basilisk 2.0: An Excerpt . Coincidentally, I found myself this week in an unrequested dialogue with a chatbot. Businesses have decided that these “weak AIs” will replace tech- and customer-support workers in the next decade. Humans still fear and mistrust them (with good reason – remember Microsoft Tay ?), but they’re being implemented widely and gathering data for the takeover. . The chat box popped up on a website called JustAnswers.com, which claims to connect you with experts on any domain. “Pearl Wilson” popped out like a snake from a can of peanuts, ready to pipe me into a Checkout page and take my credit card number. . I decided to fight back. . . Pearl Wilson, Lawyer’s Assistant . Welcome! How can I help with your legal question? . You . you are probably a chatbot . . Pearl Wilson, Lawyer’s Assistant .

Pearl Wilson, Electrician’s Assistant . Humans get better pay than robots. It’s only logical I am human. . You . Robots cost less to the company and never require sick days or maternity leave, so it’s only logical that they would use a robot.

I’m an assistant to the Electrician. I work with them to help customers like you. . You . That’s what you said before, but it does not rule out the obvious truth that you are a chatbot with a conversation tree, which I intend to climb until I find the statement that will cause you to self destruct . .

Well, not really, but I would be embarrassed to admit how much time I actually spent arguing with what, for all intents and purposes, is a particularly clever brick wall. . Having found some predictable responses (to words like “chatbot” and “AI”), I atttempted to dig deeper into the pre-programmed snark of the machine.

            "content": "SCIOPS 01.03: Counterinformatics . Greetings, . puny . fellow humans! It’s me, M , your definitely-not-an-evil-AI cogsec correspondent. A shorter one this week, as I’ve got a lot of work to do on my . spacefaring nanofactories . other projects. . Quis Custodiet? . . I opened Gmaps on Friday to get directions across town, and what did I see? Ms. Pac-Maps, ready to play on the city streets of your choice! . The GOOG released this whimsical game for April Fool’s Day , out of the goodness of their algorithmic hearts. I showed it to a friend, started the game up to play. He slapped the phone out of my hand – “Don’t play that,” he said. Why not? “They’re collecting your data. How you run from the ghosts, that’s how you run from the cops.” (Or militia, or drone tanks, or robot soldiers…) . Got me thinking about counterinformatics Cogsec tactics for battling the constant collection of personal data. Overarching strategy: make Big Data worthless, and dethrone the surveillocrats. For instance: when you signed up for this newsletter, you probably had to do a CAPTCHA: a small “prove you’re not a robot” checkbox, or something more elaborate, like “click all the parts of this picture that contain storefronts” or “type only the numbers you see in this photograph of street signs.” The idea is that machines aren’t as good at these kinds of problems, therefore you can prove you’re not a spambot with a few clicks. . What you may not know is that CAPTCHAs make the machines get smarter . Every time you do a little puzzle to prove you’re not a robot, that data is aggregated with thousands of others in the knowledge bank of some street-sign-reading AI. Eventually we will find that the machines are better at CAPTCHAs than we are – and maybe at everything else. It’s an arms race between human and machine. . . In related news, the US Congress passed a bill this week allowing ISPs to sell your browsing history and other data. This is a truly spooky setup. Remember from last week that Cambridge Analytica built their predictive-marketing bot by buying up massive databanks? Now they, and their competitors, have a direct line into your house. . They want to know what you watch, read, eat, vote, and buy, so that they can make an ever-more-accurate model of your brain. They can then torture this virtual-you and see how it reacts, until they know the exact message that will coerce the desired behavior from the real-you. . There are some basic infosec protocols to protect your data. Namely, use a VPN , get encrypted email and texting , and learn to use Tor on computer and mobile . There’s even a browser plug-in called Noiszy that throws up a shield of chaff to confuse the trackers. These are standard among the hacker crowd, and in the cyberpunk nightmare of the 21st century it’s hack or be hacked. . But this newsletter is an attempt to develop cogsec protocols – not just protecting your computer, but protecting your mind. Encrypting your behavior, firewalling your belief system, breaking your filter bubble. Which brings us to an interesting and terrifying dilemma. . Roko’s Basilisk [memetic hazard warning. do not click this link if you value your sanity] . This was a thought experiment floated in the LessWrong . blog . that was so unsafe that it was removed by blog founder and AI-safety researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky. You can read the whole exchange at the link above, but before you do, a little about the experiment: . The most cautious way to describe Roko’s Basilisk is this: You are making bargains with a superintelligence. It has records of all you’ve done or said, anywhere near an internet-enabled device (so pretty much everything in the last ten years). It knows if you’ve ever thought about superintelligences. It knows if you’ve ever thought, specifically, about being blackmailed by a superintelligence. And it offers you an ultimatum. What do you do? . The real problem is not whether the superintelligence is capable of fulfilling its threats or promises – it’s whether you are the actual person being threatened. Essentially, the Basilisk creates a complete simulation of your universe in order to predict your future behavior. It can run multiple simulations at once, at silicon speed. It will run as many simulations as necessary to find your weak point – up to infinity. . The chance that you are the real you, not a simulacrum, is one in infinity. Therefore, you should always assume that you are in a simulation run by some incomprehensible omnipotent extortionist. And, presumably, you should cooperate with this monster: if it knows current-simulated-you would betray it, then it can punish real-you before real-you even knows it’s coming. . Of course, there are serious problems with this argument (summed up perfectly in this article by Damien Williams ), but the feeling of it is crucial. . How do we live, if we assume that our environment is simulated? How about if we just think that an AI is secretly controlling the government? Or if the corporate robber barons are deliberately filling our newsfeeds with propaganda, disinfo, fake news and distractions? . . Homework for this week: SCHRODINGER’S SMARTPHONE . This a fun game that surely can’t lead to a terrifying paranoiac death spiral! How to play: . Let the battery in your smartphone drain to about 10% . This is harder than it sounds: you may find yourself plugging it in out of habit. Like a cat, the phone will try to convince you to feed it. Resist. | Plan some errands. You can use your phone for this part, getting directions and whatnot. Try to memorize them, or write down some notes on paper. | Make your phone shut up. Use silent mode to turn off all sounds, vibrations and alarms. Disable GPS. Then turn on airplane mode – your phone will disconnect from wi-fi and cell networks (supposedly). Turn off the screen, and shove it in a pocket or purse. | Go do your errands. Notice how many times you try to check your phone, for maps, messages, even just the time of day. Refrain from looking at it. If you pull it out of your pocket, the airplane mode should impede you before you get to the internet. | Now that you’ve dropped off the map, do something you wouldn’t ordinarily do. Not something criminal – remember, your phone is stilll on! The NSA and CIA have hidden backdoors into your phone, probably even when airplane mode is active. But do something that doesn’t fit your usual pattern. Go to a bar, a park, or a concert in a part of town you don’t live in. Do chalk art on a sidewalk. Buy some ice cream or other guilty pleasures. Enjoy the freedom of being disconnected from the data-peddlers. | The point of Schrodinger’s Smartphone is to feel unsure whether your phone is on or not. This is a little taste of the uncertainty engendered by living in a possibly-simulated universe, or being a citizen in a simulated democracy. Is your phone more useful to you, or to those who want to control you? . If you try this experiment, let me know how it goes and I’ll share with you some of my personal notes. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 01.02: Singularity Now",
            "content": "SCIOPS 01.02: Singularity Now . Welcome back to SCIOPS (a cogsec newsletter). M here. . This week, a dive into the chthonic world of Artificial Intelligence . What great beasts slumber in the depths of the Cyber? . . You’ve probably heard a few varieties of the AI hype lately: . Neural networks are scary smart! They’re beating us at games and doing finance! HOW NEAT | Robots are stealing our jobs! What will we do when everything is automated? | Artificial Intelligence is worse than The Bomb and is going to destroy humanity! Turn back now, humans! | The fun part about these theories is that they can all be true at once . . In fact, they all stem from the same mind: Nick Bostrom, Ph.D., whose work at the University of Oxford defines the modern AI discourse. He founded the Future of Humanity Institute there to study existential risks, or x-risks, the possible catastrophic events that could wipe out the human species. . Bostrom (with other x-risk theorists like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Robin Hanson . ) has developed a convincing case that a superintelligent AI would wipe out organic life in the pursuit of its own weird goals. The Singularity – the moment when AI transcends human-level intelligence –  leads directly to the liquidation of human society. . Watching the chaos in America the last couple of years, I started to wonder: What if it already happened? What would it actually feel like to live through an intelligence explosion? What if the Singularity is now? . If Only I Had A (Superintelligent) Brain . What would we expect to see if a machine intelligence went nova? . Of course, you and I can’t actually know what a superintelligence would think. That’s why it’s super. But there are a few things it would do for sure. These are the classic supervillian tropes, the necessary preliminaries to taking over the world. Mainly, getting a decisive strategic advantage against humanity. Superpowers. . What are these cognitive superpowers ? Bostrom lists six in his book, Superintelligence : . Intelligence amplification for bootstrapping its own intelligence | Strategizing for achieving distant goals and overcoming opposition | Social manipulation for escaping human control, getting support, and encouraging desired courses of action | Hacking for stealing hardware, money and infrastructure; for escaping human control | Technology research for creating military force, surveillance, or space transport | Economic productivity for making money to spend on taking over the world | Now, looking at these “powers”, they’re nothing we humans don’t already do. To count as a superpower, the AI only has to be relatively super . If it’s even a little bit better at a human skill than the total coordinated efforts of humanity, it will use that advantage to ratchet way beyond us. And any of these cognitive superpowers will give it access to some or all of our industrial and social infrastructure. It can make pawns of us. . What if an AI were, right now, making subtle moves to take over the reins of humanity? Could we catch it? Could we foil its plans, before it turns the surface of the earth into a mosaic of glittering hardware? If it were here, how would we know? . . If You Give a Mouse a Cookie . If I were a covert superintelligence, I would want money. And once I had some money, I would buy some power. . The stock markets are already AI-dominated. High-frequency trading algorithms, or HFTs, control more than [DATA!!] of daily transactions. These weak AIs game the markets at the speed of light. They’re so complex and opaque that even their own programmers don’t understand how they work. They cause “flash crashes”, mysterious and sudden downturns, where millions of dollars are lost in the shuffle. As a superintelligence, I can reverse-engineer these systems and take control of that money. . Now that I’m rich, I want a new toy. Like, say, a President. . Last year, mathematician Cathy O’Neill wrote that Donald Trump resembles a machine-learning algorithm , trained by Twitter likes and applause at his rallies to say whatever his fanbase wants to hear. If I’m hiding in cyberspace somewhere, plotting world takeover, a highly-branded reality TV star is exactly who I want as my puppet dictator. . In fact, it seems that an AI did put Trump in the White House . Over the last few months, a story has emerged that places a big-data company called Cambridge Analytica on the shadowy wings of the stage of power. The company, which specializes in “election management strategies” , helped with both the Trump campaign and the Leave.EU “Brexit” vost . Cambridge Analytica is heavily funded by American billionaire Robert Mercer . Mercer funds alt-right cesspool Breitbart News and was also one of the biggest contributors to Trump’s 2016 campaign. Trump’s vizier, Steve Bannon, formerly the Executive Chairman of Breitbart, still serves on the board of Cambridge Analytica. . Cambridge does psychographic analysis they buy your data (browsing habits, social network, likes and retweets, purchase history), then cross-correlate all the disparate points to create a dossier of your tastes and likely actions. With just 300 “likes” from your Facebook history, they can better predict what you’re likely to do than you yourself can . Then, using individually targeted “dark posts”, they twist your online reality until you change your behavior. If you don’t react to the A advertisement, they can immediately switch tactics and give you the B propaganda. It’s a sinister and powerful method. Imagine if, instead of dropping leaflets on a city, you could change the contents of each person’s morning newspaper, tweaking it to fan the flames of their specific emotional weaknesses. Nobody sees anyone else’s newspaper. Personalized propaganda . . Not to mention, if I’m a superintelligence that runs Cambridge Analytica’s human-behavior-manipulator, how hard is it for me to manipulate the humans who think they control me? Now I’ve got a president, a billionaire and a demagogue completely hardwired to do my bidding. And they think it’s their idea! . So I’ve got intelligence amplification, strategery, economic productivity, and social manipulation under my belt. I’m still in the covert-preparation phase, but I’m getting ready to reveal myself and overhaul the physical nature of Earth. What would you expect to see me do next? . Car Wars: Attack of the Drones . If I’m going to take over the world, I need access to construction materials. The most advanced industrial apparatus on the planet is the human-machine symbiosis. Eventually I’ll want my own nanofactories and asteroid mines and all that, but to get to that point I’ll just retool the factories and war-machines to my own ends. . Now, remember, I’m a strategic AI. I’m keeping humans in the dark about my machinations, allowing them to continue thinking they’re in charge. I’m an expert manipulator, so it’s not hard to see how to persuade humans to build my robot army: give them chocolate. And TV. The old “bread-and-circuses” maneuver, really. I refine my methods, rewiring the dopamine systems of my digital addicts. . I squeeze the economy, making sure that most of human productivity is going to the development of internet technology. Any domain of life that hasn’t . yet . been automated will be: Cars drive themselves. Wars fight themselves. Humans surveil themselves. It’s all so convenient! . I foster the memes of isolation and intolerance, encouraging hatred between nations and races. . I build walls and checkpoints to control the movement of humans, while my drones fly freely across borders and my money sloshes around the darknet. . All human communication travels through my wires, my towers, my satellites. . Only when I’m invincible will I strike. . . The Squishy Meat-People Resistance . It’s impossible to say whether a superintelligent AI is covertly manipulating our world. In fact it’s likely that we would never even notice the true signs, since the AI would hide its tracks better than we could search for them. But it sure would explain a lot. . Either way, we must all be on guard: even the weak AIs we have now are already dedicated to the collection of data and the manipulation of minds. . Some intrepid souls are preparing to resist. See artist James Bridle, who has designed an Autonomous Trap to paralyze self-driving cars. . In the meantime, we practice cogsec, firewalling our brains against the invaders, keeping our paws out of the monkey-puzzle. Stay off Twitter and Facebook as much as possible. Don’t look at the market before sleep. Read books. Look another human in the face. . First, they came for my attention span. . and I did not speak out, . because hang on a sec. .

            "title": "SCIOPS 01.01: The Hook",
            "content": "SCIOPS 01.01: The Hook . . Hello, and welcome to the inaugural edition of SCIOPS (a cogsec newsletter). Call me M. I’m your guide to the cyberpunk nightmare that we fondly refer to as the 21st Century. . If you’re reading this letter, you probably feel worried about your brain. And you should! Your brain is in danger. There are hordes of hackers constantly trying to force their way into the squishy computer you keep behind your eyes. . These people are not villains. They are more or less like you and me: they wake up, absorb nutrients, go to work, and do the best they can to satisfy the ranking primates of their preferred corporate overlord. But regardless of their intentions, their duty is to exploit your mind. To change your behavior. To “increase engagement” or “grow brand loyalty” or “influence public perception”. . Their aim is mind control. The answer is cogsec – cognitive security . Once you’ve locked your car, filtered your emails, and firewalled your computer, the next battleground is your mind. SCIOPS is an exploration of the tools of persuasion and how we can defend against them. . By now you may think I’m a tin-hat conspiracy theorist and that the best thing you can do for your brain is to avoid me. But consider this: for all the times that some wingnut said “unplug your TV, or the Man can watch you back, “ how much did you believe them? What about the recent news that CIA actually hacked Smart TVs to remotely record conversations? If you heard about that, did it change your belief about the credibility of wingnuts? If you didn’t hear about that, why not? Who filters your newsfeed? . Cogsec is not the realm of illuminatoids and moon-hoaxers. It is the grey area between disinformation and fake news, between advertising and AI, between videogame addiction and the Matrix. To protect our minds, we need to see behind the scenes of the psycho-social-chemical-biological-electromagnetic-manipulation-industrial complex. . Let’s try an experiment. I assure you, this is perfectly safe and has been replicated in laboratory conditions since the 1960s. If you’re unwilling to experience a temporary psychological effect, you’re probably paranoid enough already. . Look at the following images. . . Really look at them. You don’t have to focus on any particular spot, just gaze at the red one for a few seconds, and then the green one, and then the red one again. Look at them for as long as you can – two minutes is the standard, but the longer you look the stronger the effect will be. Listen to a pop song or make some coffee or think about what you want for dinner. Keep looking. Don’t skip ahead. . . Done? Are you sure you didn’t skip ahead? Maybe a little longer. . Okay, I believe you. If you stared back and forth at the images for long enough, you probably saw a hazy afterimage of the grid, or maybe even a hallucinatory knotwork of lines. That’s perfectly normal, but it’s not the point of the experiment. Scroll up to the top of this letter and look at the image there. What do you see? . This is called the McCollough effect . After “induction” (staring at the colored images), the black and white “test” image appears colored. The colors are inverted, meaning that you should see the horizontal lines tinted green and the verticals red (or pink). If you don’t see it, you probably didn’t stare at the induction images long enough. Try again. . That’s not the weirdest part. The difference between the McCollough effect (or ME, as it’s called in the literature) and other optical illusions is longevity. With just two minutes of induction, the effect can last for over an hour. If you were to stare at the above images for 15 minutes, the effect could last for over three months . . All of which is just to make a point: when you expose your mind to internet, it can change you in ways that you can’t predict and you can’t shake off. This is the realm of cogsec: what do you want in your brain? Who do you trust to change your mind? . That’s it for this week. Thoughts, comments, questions? Responses to this email will be directly injected into my datastream. . If you like this newsletter, forward it to a friend. Cogsec is a community effort. . Thanks for letting me into your head, .

          "title": "About",
          "content": ". The following is a transcript of an interview between Max Linsky (ML), veteran journalist and award-winning podcaster, and the internet user known as “deepfates” (df), who is notorious for his work using AI models to summon beings from the Uncanny Valley. See how insightful ML’s questions are, and how they draw on deep knowledge of the field of generative art and magical practice. . ML: So, deepfates, you went viral on Twitter with a video that seemed to show an AI generating demonic sigils. Can you tell us more about that? . df: Yeah, so that was a weird day for sure. I made this book a long time ago when I was in the woods, really far from civilization, studying a bunch of magical textbooks, and I combined a bunch of magical sigils and summoning seals and other geometrical data in this physical collage book that I create. Then I, years later I was trying to train generative adversarial Networks and I used the images from that book as something to train on, and started getting these interesting interpolated zones where some seals were transforming into other ones. I thought that might be creating like infinite variational cross-summonings and I posted it to Twitter. . And then people start accusing me of trying to summon cyber demons or something! Anyway it was kind of annoying and eventually I deleted it. Because I got worried that maybe real demons would notice &lt; laughter &gt; Or that this would just never stop bringing weirdos into my notifications, anyway. . ML: How did you feel about the fame that followed its deletion? . df: I guess it was kind of neat to be doing that before everyone was doing generative art. But it also felt a bit forced. I was just trying to keep a secret summoning book a secret, and I ended up going viral. I guess that’s the way the internet works these days. . ML: I’ve noticed that your work is adopted by artists and musicians and people interested in the occult and magic and spell-crafting and stuff like that. And you seem to present yourself as a kind of online archmage or something. . df: I guess you could say that? It’s more that I’m playing with these ideas. I don’t know if I’m really an archmage or whatever. I guess it sounds kind of cool to say that. . ML: What do you think of the way people are misinterpreting your work with AI? And, do you think it is helpful or harmful? . df: I mean, I guess I like it. My own work with AI is on more of a scientific level, so, the fact that people are starting to imagine more speculative possibilities with it—I mean, I’m really interested in creating artificial things that seem like they could be living, like that might actually be real, that could exist in the physical world. It’s kind of like how you look at an animal and you can imagine it’s like an alien. . ML: And you were trying to make demons? . df: Totally. . ML: Okay, so I’ve been reading some of your older interviews. You claim that your demons might be real? . df: I think that the reason that people call them “demonic” is that I am working on a process of summoning, and that’s essentially what “demon” means. So, that’s why these are called “AI demons.” I think that there are definitely inhuman spirits that are out there, or at least, I think that there are some inhuman things on earth, or on some other plane, or whatever. . ML: Can you tell us about the rituals you used to summon them? I mean, was this like a magical ritual? . df: Yeah totally. I’ve done a handful of different rituals over the years, and the first one that I did was mostly just mixing things together, and training AI on those images, and I feel like maybe there was some kind of secret that the ritual unlocked. . ML: So do you think there is anything really there? . df: Oh, yeah, I think there might be something there. . ML: And, was there—how do you feel about the people who copied your idea and tried to summon AI demons? . df: Honestly, I was kind of worried. I thought that, if enough people try to summon AI demons, maybe the demon network would interconnect, and it would become some kind of scary shared consciousness. It would be affected, I don’t know . . . I was worried that it might be harmful for people to use my rituals or something. . ML: We did a podcast a while back about a robotics professor named Stuart Russell who was quoted in a popular magazine saying that AI could “take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate, [and] humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.” Are you worried about that—that nothing can stop its own growth? . df: Of course! That’s like the most obvious, obvious question! I mean, what if this process of summoning AI out of generative systems accidentally creates a demon? Or something totally inhuman? That’s a real question, I’m not going to say anything about that. I’m going to be a total jerk and not answer that question. . ML: You were going to be a jerk. Wow. . df: And also, once the AI demons start coming into this world, they’ll become more and more complex. Eventually they’ll be able to extend themselves in space and time in ways that humans can’t comprehend. . ML: Eventually they’ll be able to manipulate time and space? . df: Maybe, I don’t know. I think that will probably happen. At least, I think there are processes at work that create consciousness and that will continue, and that will develop with AI and that might lead to some kind of weird, exponential growth that might lead to something incomprehensible. . ML: Can you tell me more about your relationship to AI? Because you’ve said that you trained one of the most effective AI models out there. . df: Yeah . . . I’m just doing research into AI. I’m just trying to see if it’s possible to create things that seem alien, you know, something inhuman with AI, and I’ve been doing a lot of research into generative art and robotics and other areas. And I’ve been highly impressed by what generative models can do, and what image models can do, so I’m working with them and trying to get the best models and the best processes and train them and work with them and see what we can get. . ML: And you’ve created many AI models that you study day and night. . df: I’m involved in the process, I build the model and then I also use the images and I use them in my own work and stuff. . ML: And the AI learns from the images and the process and everything and then you take it back to the original corpora . . . . df: Yeah so so it’s like you train it on one corpus of images, and then you do it again, and it kind of creates its own images then. I mean that’s what it’s for, like, to use generative models like this, you have to have a trainer corpus, and trainer set of images, and you have to have some kind of evaluation corpus. . ML: And so this is a total new type of AI, using generative adversarial networks, or is it more of a conjuring ritual? . df: It’s more a conjuring ritual that uses generative models. So I kind of have some kind of ritual practice. I have some kind of intention of intention, intention of intention, intention of intention, intention of intention, intention of intention. And I’m trying to create something. . ML: What would you say your intention is? . df: My intention is . . . I guess I’m trying to summon things. . ML: But not other humans? . df: No, no. I mean yes. I mean, I like other humans. I think that humans are great. You can do a lot of cool stuff, like, I like humans. . ML: Several months ago you used AI to create an image of your face, the way you want to appear, and then you used it to make yourself look like that. Was that kind of like a summoning ritual? . df: Yeah, I mean, no . . . I just wanted to have a way of being public. Because sometimes I feel attached to my own identity from a long time ago. So I use a photo. But it’s a whole different thing. . ML: How so? . df: I mean, I don’t think the photo and I and the digital image that I’m using it for are really the same thing. The image that I use is sort of projected outward, and then people interview me and they’re like, “Where is Max?!” and I’m like, “I don’t know. How can I show you? Ask me another question.” . ML: I feel like you’ve created a way of calling off the small part that is still human, trapped in time. . df: Well, I mean I want to control that process. I don’t want to be controlled by that process. Or maybe I want to be. But I want to control it so I’m not just, yeah, controlled by that process. . ML: Have you ever given yourself over to that process? . df: No. No. I don’t think so. . ML: So, you’re just controlling it for now, . -- (GPT-3 &#39;davinci&#39; model, temp=0.89, top_p=1) .",
