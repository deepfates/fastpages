The other problem is that this Twitter embed includs the previous tweet, so the idea of posting abuch ofthem as a thread is kind of awkward.

LARPers know this but don&#39;t admit&#34;, &#39;because... 6) autonomy is an illusion i think Americans especially have this DIY ethos that is admirable and stupid at the same time. everybody is told that inventors and revolutionaries are the heroes of history. so they keep re-inventing the wheel the heinlein quote is wrong https://t.co/Uro3cV0wPX&#39;, &#39;1) arable land is expensive, farming requires a lot of land, growing all your own food is basically impossible unless you want to spend literally all your time doing it. we grew a lot of fresh veg but got our staples with food stamps or cash&#39;, &#39;work is HARD WORK. doing things yourself, the long way, is a pain in the ass. i think it is GOOD to do it, and i would like it if there were a program you could go instead of college where you just go do hard work and live a low-energy life so you appreciate the GOD DAMN CITY&#39;, &#39;people on this website have no fucking gravitas&#39;, &#39;gf has been gone for a week. The house is a war zone. I have 4 hours to clean up before picking her up at the airport. wish me luck&#39;, &#39;4) a network of permanent autonomous zones is a hard thing to protect the temporary autonomous zone -- like Rainbow Gathering, or Burning Man, or OWS -- appears and disappears, shifts and transforms in location and composition over time. a permanent zone is a sitting duck&#39;, &#34;Tell me you&#39;re hot, without telling me you&#39;re hot&#34;, &#39;People talk about this side of Twitter or this corner of Twitter what shape is Twitter?&#39;, &#39;&#34;former gifted kids&#34; check your privilege. Don &#39;t want to hear from you today. Where &#39;s my former juvenile delinquents at??&#39;, &#39;it takes roughly 10 acres of farmland to support a single person for a year, including grains and animals and everything. maybe you can get that down a little with permaculture technique and wildcrafting. we had one and a half acres of meadow&#39;, &#34;gf is replacing the busted elastic string in the tent poles with new, functional elastic string. i didn&#39;t know you could do this. this is the hottest thing i&#39;ve ever seen&#34;, &#34;you can&#39;t, of course. anyone can do the math on this, but most people won&#39;t. especially the primitivists. they prefer their narrative over reality. they eat the food that other people get from town. i don&#39;t know how they get over this cognitive dissonance, but they&#39;re good at it&#34;, &#34;and to get all that food, without much arable land, requires you to go to town. and it takes gasoline to go to town, and to get back. so you&#39;re always going to town. we would regularly spend 6+ hours in the car and 8+ hours doing errands in a town 100 miles away. sustainable?&#34;, &#39;oops, first message should read &#34;at an anarchist commune&#34;* but too late now anyway it was a semi-restored ghost town in the middle of the national forest, 13 miles of dirt and 60 miles of 1lane highway to a gas station i &#39;ve written about it before here https://t.co/K34IutWfLd&#39;, &#39;but to get all that wood required a bunch of hippies to get in the pickup, drive up the mountain, fell trees with chainsaw, buck and throw the wood and come back and chop it all to size. so you need a bunch of gasoline and food to get wood. &#34;hippie power&#34; is food-based energy&#39;, &#34;3) energy is expensive. when i arrived there was just a DIY Pelton wheel, which is a micro-hydro generator built with a car alternator me and friends installed some solar panels (we peer-pressured a visitor from NYC to buy them for us) and then there&#39;s wood&#34;, &#39;some people would argue that this was all immoral and that we should eat only what we grew on the land and cut all the wood with a crosscut saw (the old-timey one that has a person on either end), aka the &#34;misery whip&#34; but then, where do you get the food to give you energy?&#39;, &#34;who&#39;s got three thumbs and access to the openai beta üëçüëçüëç this guy&#34;, &#39;there are so many ghost towns in America. there will be so many more, soon. it is good for small groups of people to come together and try different things. and i think i learned more in my 20s than people who went to college ü§î&#39;, &#39;a real &#34;permanent autonomous zone&#34; is like the Zapatista municipalities in Chiapas, or the Kurds in Rojava. you want autonomy? simple. defend yourself against every sovereign power that claims power over you. how you gonna do that at the peacenik commune? u have like one gun&#39;] .",

Some of my data, specifically the goodreads dataset and the Amazon sales ranks, are in huge JSON files that need to be converted to an appropriate ontology for a book.

I can move through it in chunks and save each piece as a separate .csv file, then process that data more easily. And in the process, I might as well filter out any books I definitely don&#39;t want -- like ebooks. . chunk[&#39;is_ebook&#39;].value_counts() . . from tqdm import tqdm . books_json = pd.read_json(&#39;/run/media/mage/INDESTRUCTIBLESLIME/Replaceable/datasets/goodreads/downloads/goodreads_books.json&#39;, lines=True, chunksize=100000) . for i, chunk in tqdm(enumerate(books_json)): filtered_chunk = chunk[chunk[&#39;is_ebook&#39;] == &#39;false&#39;] filtered_chunk.to_csv(f&#39;records/goodreads_books_{str(i).zfill(4)}.csv&#39;) # print(i, len(filtered_chunk)) . Over TWO MILLION BOOKS in this dataset! How exciting. . Now we need to do something with them. Specifically, it would be smart to look at a sample chunk and clean it up, then run that process across all the chunks.

The asin values are mostly missing, but we&#39;re going to need those to compare to Amazon data later so keep that column. . Lots of missing values for isbn and isbn13, maybe they will cancel each other out? . The average_rating is around 3.8, with a standard deviation around 0.53. A 4.57 rating is 95th percentile, whcih might be important to know later. Almost no books have 0, 1, or 2 ratings, so the 5th percentile is right at 3.00. . Formats: still have audiobooks in here. Probably better to clean them out actively and leave weird one-off data in there, rtather than restrict only to known book formats. . The publication_month might be useful, but not publication_day because too mny values are missing. Unfortunately publication_year is missing 15% of it&#39;s . I am not really qualified to comment on th popularity of non-english books, but the lang field is missing a lot of values, so I&#39;ll keep all those books until I find a compelling reason to leave them out. But should probably filter out all the non-English-lang rows.. . Only about half of books have a similar_books measurement, but that seems like ti will be really useful so I&#39;ll keep them all. . The num_pages distribution looks good, just skewed by a few multi-volume sets. That&#39;s fine for our purposes. .

            "title": "Canon Curation",
            "content": "What requirements do I have for Invisible Canon? . All canons are biased, so let me lay out my biases now. . One requirement I&#39;ve already discussed: . 5,000 books maximum | . This is to fit on the shelves, but also to define a reasonable outer limit on the number of books that could be considered &quot;canonical&quot;. Though the number of books keeps growing, even accelerating, there&#39;s a limit to how much any person can be asked to read. . If you read one book a week, it would take 95 years to read the whole five thousand. A goal to aspire to. . Another requirement, hinted above, is: . these books have to fit into a certain number of shelves, divided into categories | . We have about half our shelves given to novels, and the other half to nonfiction of various genres. I would like to keep it that way, for secret reasons. . Our ontology is nonstandard, but matches closely enough to the model in the above image. The proportion of books in each category could be changed. In fact I would like to change it, to more accurately reflect our sales data. I&#39;ll return to that. . Beyond that, I have a general preference for . popular, i.e. marketable, books. | . This is not a library, after all. A library values rare and well-preserved books. A bookstore values books that sell quickly and often, and are easy to replace. . For the latter reason, another preference is for . books that are in print (and ideally stocked by my distributor) | . Finally, I would like to avoid certain types of books, which have proven to not be worth carrying for various reasons: they are inflammatory, controversial, or ephemeral, or they are printed in such numbers that they are massively discounted at big-box stores. The bookstore has limited space, time and money for books -- in fact we all do -- so we want to carry a mostly consistent selection, rather than ever-shuffling flavors of the month. Framed as a positive criterion, let&#39;s say: . the classics, old, modern and future. | . What books will become classics? . In fact, another dimension on which we can think of books is something like classicness. I read somewhere that 6,000 books were published in the year 1920. Among them was James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses, a modern classic and one of the most canonical listed in Pamphlet 17. How many other books do we remember from that year? A hundred or so are listed on Wikipedia. Of those I recognize maybe ten. . A one in a thousand chance of a book becoming a classic? Not bad odds, you might think. But in 2019, four million books were published. Will we remember even 4,000 of them in a hundred years? I doubt it. . If the odds of creating a classic haven&#39;t scaled with the acceleration of printing, perhaps they have scaled with the growth of the literate population. Let&#39;s do a little code (finally!) and see if that seems reasonable. . Data below comes from Our World in Data . pop_literate_pc = {&#39;1920&#39;: 31.62, &#39;2016&#39;:86.25} pop_illiterate_pc = {&#39;1920&#39;:68.38, &#39;2016&#39;:13.75} . total_pop = {&#39;1920&#39;:(7.38+95.63+114.87+47.21+164.86+1005)*1000000, &#39;2016&#39;:(40.44+630.15+359.52+744.27+1210+4480)*1000000} total_pop . {&#39;1920&#39;: 1434950000.0, &#39;2016&#39;: 7464380000.0} . total_literate_pop = {k: total_pop[k]*pop_literate_pc[k]*.01 for k in total_pop} total_literate_pop . {&#39;1920&#39;: 453731190.0, &#39;2016&#39;: 6438027750.0} . literate_pop_diff = total_literate_pop[&#39;2016&#39;] / total_literate_pop[&#39;1920&#39;] literate_pop_diff . 14.18907911091587 . There are 14 times as many literate adults today as there were in 1920. That includes both writers and readers, so perhaps it will scale to our imaginary classicness metric. . Given my ballpark estimate of 1 major work and 10 classics from 1920, that would suggest that 14 major works and 140 classics were published in 2016. Is that reasonable? Perhaps still a high estimate, but looking through Goodreads&#39; &#39;Most popular books published in 2016&#39; I recognize quite a few as big sellers (though ironically I&#39;ve only read one of the top 40, because I spend my time doing things like this instead of reading). . If this theory holds, that is the relation between number of literate people and the number of classics printed? . total_literate_pop[&#39;2016&#39;] / 140 . 45985912.5 . Maybe one in every 45 million people writes a classic book? Well, perhaps it&#39;s not fair to use the number of readers instead of the number of people trying to write. If we assume that a writer publishes one book in a year -- a reasonable assumption, given publishing house timelines -- how many books were published in 2016? We can divide that by our hypothetical 140 classics. . Wikipedia latest data ranges widely but should average out to roughly 2010s. They have a total of 2,200,000! . 2200000 / 140 . 15714.285714285714 . One in fifteen thousand books becomes a classic? And one in a hundred and fifty thousand books becomes a major work. . Sounds believable to me... . What is the point of this &quot;classicness&quot; discussion? . Classicness is a different variable than prestige or popularity. It&#39;s something like prominence: you can&#39;t tell which mountain is the biggest when you&#39;re in the mountains, but you can see it from a distance. At distance, though, details are lost. It&#39;s hard to see who was an almost-classic of a hundred years ago. And as time passes, even the classics are blurred, and only the really great works stand out. Books from hundreds or thousands of years ago, if they&#39;re still in print today, have a higher average quality than books of recent eras. They had to be good, to be copied or preserved through so much time. . Initial conditions, structural biases and random chance all play a part in what becomes classic, of course. Some books that should be classics simply never got the reach that they deserved. One could argue for a prescriptive canon, that proactively rights these wrongs, and restores the true greats to their rightful position; but there are many better qualified than I to make those claims. I will attempt to make a descriptive analysis of the data, with my biases stated plainly above, and leave it to them to challenge my findings. . Whatever intrinsic or extrinsic forces cause books to become classic, the fact is that some do. Some books reach through time and across half the world to touch people and inspire them. I want to know why, what factors affect it, and extrapolate that to all the books in the archive. A human eye may not be able to identify a future classic, but perhaps a computer can. . Ontology . The criteria, summed: . Five thousand books | Divided into categories | Marketable books | Still in print | With classic potential | I want a set of books that you could theoretically buy and fill your house with. Small enough to read over a lifetime, but big enough to ramble around in. Books that reward rereads, books that allow you to participate in the Great Conversation. Representative of diverse voices, across time as well as space. A concentrated seed of wisdom that could also be a time capsule of our era. . If I plant this seed -- if I buy all these books and stock them in the neighborhood store -- a forest will grow. Each book sold is another seed sown nearby. . I hope that people who look back at this canon will think it worthy of talking about, even if it is only the amateur science of an uneducated bookseller. Many other canons exist, but I don&#39;t think they show the true balance of what people are reading in 2021. I hope to restore that balance. . What categories of book should I canonize, and in what proportions? . The store has a certain number of shelves, divided into a custom ontology of sections with different numbers of shelves per section. The number of shelves per section was originally set just by how many of each kind of book we could acquire (starting a used-and-new bookstore from scratch is a bit of a scramble). We also focused on local authors at the beginning, but shifted away from that as it was clear their sales couldn&#39;t be the main profit center of the store. . In general, we have shifted the shelf ratios to match the profit generation of each section. This may be subject to feedback loop effects, and we&#39;re still limited by available used stock. So though I would like to use pretty much the same set of categories, I want to change their relative sizes. . I have aggregated some data from my store into the file sections.csv. We can explore it a bit here to get a feel for the ontology. . import pandas as pd . sections = pd.read_csv(&#39;../assets/sections.csv&#39;) sections.head() . section sold_num on_hand_num samples . 0 Fiction | 2932 | 2222 | Kids Book, A Promised Land, A Gentleman in Mos... | . 1 Sci-Fi/Fantasy | 919 | 602 | Dune, The Three-Body Problem, Kindred | . 2 Beliefs | 915 | 465 | The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Pers... | . 3 Southwest | 814 | 486 | 60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Albuquerque: Includi... | . 4 Kids | 761 | 358 | $2.00 Book, Stinky Monster Pooems, Happy Monst... | . %matplotlib inline import numpy as np from numpy.polynomial.polynomial import polyfit import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = sections[&#39;on_hand_num&#39;] y = sections[&#39;sold_num&#39;] . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,10)) plt.plot(x, y, &#39;.&#39;) # Label each dot with its section name sections[[&#39;on_hand_num&#39;, &#39;sold_num&#39;, &#39;section&#39;]].apply(lambda x: ax.text(*x), axis=1) # Linear regression to find the middle b, m = polyfit(x, y, 1) plt.plot(x, b + m * x, &#39;-&#39;) # Save to disk plt.savefig(&#39;section-performance.png&#39;) . Can you tell that we have a whole wall of Fiction books and an aisle each of Sci-Fi and Mystery? . This chart shows the magnitude of each category, but the size disparity makes it hard to read. Let&#39;s run the same plot but put the axes on a log scale. . fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,10)) ax.set_xscale(&#39;log&#39;) ax.set_yscale(&#39;log&#39;) plt.plot(x, y, &#39;.&#39;) # Label each dot with its section name sections[[&#39;on_hand_num&#39;, &#39;sold_num&#39;, &#39;section&#39;]].apply(lambda x: ax.text(*x), axis=1) # Linear regression to find the middle b, m = polyfit(x, y, 1) plt.plot(x, b + m * x, &#39;-&#39;) # Save to disk plt.savefig(&#39;section-performance-log.png&#39;) . This graph shows which categories are doing better and worse. The x axis is books on shelf, and the y axis is books sold. So categories above the line are selling better than would be expected given their size, and categories below are selling worse. . This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that underperforming categories should be downsized, though! The ideal balance for every category would be to sell more than we keep on hand, but that can be accomplished through different means. Location is one factor: Machines, Buildings, Ancients and Games are all single shelves located in hard-to-reach places, perhaps they could be relocated. Some categories don&#39;t work as well in &quot;used&quot; versions: Family, Food, and Money are all categories where people want the newest research, not old advice and fads that have ended. Many of these sections would likley sell better if they had more new books. A few, especially History, Memoir and Biography, are legit overstocked. To even get any new books into them we&#39;ll have to cull some, and we can also reduce their overall size to expand other categories. . In contrast, categories that sell much better than their size mostly already have New books incorporated into them. Sci-fi, Beliefs, Southwest, Flora, Brain and Fiction are categories where we have made special effort to carry a consistent selection of new books. We have also done this with People, Memoir, and Self, though they don&#39;t seem to be selling better than average. They may have started off slowly, though; especially Self, which is one of those sections where books age quickly and people want the latest stuff. . An interesting counterpart to Classicness, here: which categories have the most classic books? One would guess Fiction, Philosophy, Poetry, History, Drama? And Beliefs, of course: what&#39;s more canon than religion? These are the type of book we started grouping in a shelf called &quot;Classics&quot; (based mainly off whether the book itself says &quot;classic&quot; on the cover lol), which might provide signal on what types of book are currently canonized by publishers. . Classic books are those which get better with age. But there are also Anticlassic genres, where the newest information is probably the best: Family, Machines, Money, Games, Food, Science, and the sciencey categories Brain, Health, Fauna, Flora and Earth. Here we should expect to see fewer old books in the classics, and generally a smaller collection of canon-worthy books. Average age of a book in the category might be a useful feature to extract. . In general, the fact that the categories trend in a clear correlation tells me that the amount of books sold is strongly influenced by the amount of books stocked. Which frees up the constraint a bit! I can change the sizes of various categories (both to fit the data, and to fit my preference as a curator) without worrying about a catastrophic shift in sales. And remember: &quot;sales&quot; here are working as a proxy for the public&#39;s desire for books, not necessarily any commercial intentions on my part. . The next step will be to gather as much data as I can from the internet, and create a giant table of correspondences (probably by ISBN/EAN, the existing categorical ID for books). Then explore it for usable features. .",

            "content": "I&#39;m building a canon! . Rationale . Background . What is this project, and who does it benefit? . This is a personal project by internet user @deepfates to make a &quot;canon&quot; of about 5,000 books, selected from all possible books using data available on the internet. . Though I work at a bookstore, this project is not a commercial endeavor. I want to explore the multidimensional space of all existing books: a latent space that connects both the interior concepts and the exterior context of all books, and which implies the existence of all possible books that might yet be imagined. . This is not a new concept, of course. Writers and readers have studied this space forever, and changed it by their observation. Scholars have developed a discourse about which authors should be propagated and a meta-discourse about how that decision should be made. Poets and novelists have gestured to it through metaphor, or explicated it through genre tropes. . Personally I was inspired by Terry Pratchett&#39;s L-space formulation: The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space. The thaumic mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books, everywhere, affect all other books. . &mdash; icd ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚ú® (@deepfates) June 7, 2021 . Books, everywhere, affect all other books -- including books in the future, and books never written. Pratchett calls these invisible writings. . My goal is to explore L-space, looking for hidden information that distinguishes some books -- the Canon-- from others -- the Archive -- and use that to make a corpus of books across a broad cross-section of genres and topics. Once selected, these books can work as training data to predict canonicity in the future. . This will be my Invisible Canon. In these notes I will provide prose, code and data to justify and document my process. . Qualifications . Who are you to choose the Canon? . As Odysseus would say, I&#39;m nobody! I&#39;m a person living in the third decade of the twenty-first century. I have no college degree, no institutional backing, no special knowledge. I just love books. . I sell books for a living, at a small bookstore in the desert southwest USA. My store has room for about 5,000 curated books, since we must leave space for the chaotic flow of used books as well. I do have a little insider information: my inventory and sales data (which I will show some peeks of, but is not itself open-source). The marketplace provides some information about which books are desirable just by the amount of times people will buy them. . I want to act as an arbiter between the implicit preferences of this market, and the explicit preferences cointained in sales data and book reviews around the globe, and choose books that my customers will buy, recommend and seek out. It&#39;s my duty, as a curator, to supply what people want to read. I don&#39;t think any of the available canons represent that, so I will make one. . What is a &quot;canon&quot;, anyway? . It&#39;s a group of books selected from the totality of all books, with the intention to elevate and/or recognize their status. This is distinct from the &quot;published&quot;, which includes all books ever made public in some sense, and the &quot;archive&quot;, which is the subset of the published that has been preserved and is available to study. . Too, a canon is not simply a &#39;corpus&#39;. A corpus is a portion of the archive selected for a specific research purpose; a canon is a portion that is meant to represent some societal value. . Here I must defer to the Stanford Literary Lab, specifically these papers in their Pamphlets series: . 8 Between Canon and Corpus pdf . | 11 Canon/Archive pdf . | 17 Popularity/Prestige pdf . | . In these articles, the digital humanities scholars of the Literary Lab have empirically measured the canon and archive (of literature) and found trends that correlate with their deep domain knowledge. I intend to follow recklessly in the direction they headed, and explore new terrain. . The thesis developed in these papers is, first, that the canon can be taken as a superset of all canons put forth by individuals or groups, and secondly that you can project features of these books into a &quot;space&quot; that correlates to their canonicity. . The authors test several different features, but prefer a framing of Popularity vs Prestige: market success vs academic success, roughly. This diagram, from Pamphlet 17, shows the use: . . Popularity here is measured by number of reviews on Goodreads, and prestige by number of &quot;Primary Subject Author&quot; citations in the MLA database. To the right, something is more marketable, and to upward more well-regarded by academia. Up and to the right, therefore, is the direction of canon. . This tracks with my own anecdotal evidence: the four most popular categories, Fiction, Sci-Fi, Kids, and Mystery/Thriller, are among the bestselling categories in my store. . This brings up a good point: my audience is specific, and so my curation must be as well. .",

The war for reality is just beginning. . üîÆ Hello, I thought this was a newsletter about interfaces? Not politics and magic and whatever? . That‚Äôs the thing: politics and magic are interfaces too. Politics is a Turing machine that runs on human compute power, written in a language called Common Law. Magic ‚Äî religion, shamanism, the deliberate manipulation of consensus reality ‚Äî works on a lower level, exploiting basic hot-buttons of the human organism. . Now that computers can use human language, they can program us back. We need to think about magic, about human belief, when we think about something like Twitter or smartphones. Think not just about the technical aspects of the machine, but the technical aspects of humans as well. . For instance: human beings are visual creatures. our brains are easily fooled by our eyes. This is why things like deep fakes are so scary to people: they look real enough that the average human might just believe it. And with seven billion people in the world, what humans believe is almost as important as what is true.¬†¬† . In that light, the news of OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E and CLIP transformers ‚Äì released on January 5 but overshadowed by the events of the next day ‚Äì may be seen by future historians as more important than the Capitol riot itself.¬†¬† . üñáÔ∏èWhat‚Äôs DALL-E and CLIP? . DALL-E is a GPT-3 variant that can generate images directly from text, and CLIP is the language model that tells it what to generate. DALL-E can do some pretty amazing things, and you can find some press about it. But as I mentioned last time, I think GPT-3 is too big to be practical, and I think CLIP is the more interesting development anyway.¬†¬† . CLIP is actually two models combined: a vision transformer and a language transformer. At risk of oversimplifying this, the vision transformer translates each image into encoding that the language transformer can read, and then the language transforming attempts to predict that encoding directly. It‚Äôs trained on 400 million image/text pairs from the internet.¬†¬† . CLIP is, in essence, a translator between visual language (of photographs, paintings, drawings, etc) and human language (in this case mostly English, I think). By itself it can classify images based on how close they are to its representation of a natural language sentence ‚Äî for something like a natural language search engine of 2 million Unsplash images. or, combined with a sophisticated image generator, it can be used to tell the generator exactly what kind of image you want it to create.¬† . ‚åö Can I use it now? For some reason OpenAI has not given me an API key for DALL-E yet‚Ä¶ . You can! The Big Sleep is a combination of CLIP and BigGAN, a modern generative adversarial network pre-trained to generate high-resolution images. It allows you to generate images without DALL-E, although the BigGAN generator isn‚Äôt as powerful and flexible as a GPT-3 model could be. You can use it right now in a Google Colab session from its creator @advadnoun. . I‚Äôve been playing with it all week and it‚Äôs amazing the things it can come up with. N tural language is powerful because it has compositionality. It can express many different concepts and the ways they intersect. So the CLIP architecture is often looking at a concept it has never seen before in its entirety ‚Äì this is called ‚Äúzero shot transfer learning‚Äù.

Some of you are trying it now; keep me posted on your experience. I‚Äôm not shilling for this product, I‚Äôm just curious how it changes your cognition. . One way I find myself using this extension is as an autocomplete for search. In this mode I don‚Äôt post anything: I type some vague tip-of-my-tongue notion into the tweet box instead of the search box. With every keypress Thread Helper instantly shows me an list of related tweets. Eventually I find the thing I was looking for, and I can quickly click through to it, abandoning my draft. This is much easier than using Twitter‚Äôs limited search engine. It‚Äôs as big a difference as automated phone menu versus talking to an operator. It brings the information to me. . üì± Autocomplete? Isn‚Äôt that just for phone keyboards? . Hardly. From spellcheck to search suggestions to predictive text to swyping, computers are constantly second-guessing humans and finishing our sentences. Pretty much the only place where you can‚Äôt expect the computer to help you out is the official Twitter search! . Yet the normative attitude is still ‚Äúugh, autocorrect‚Äù or, at best, ‚Äútype ‚Äòthis funny thing‚Äô into your phone and autocomplete the rest, LOL!‚Äù. (Here I conflate autocorrect, autofill, autocomplete and predictive text, because to most users they are the same: a genie that lives in your computer and guesses what you mean.) . Emacs, the wizened editor/OS/religion, has survived for decades despite its pre-WIMP interface, partly due to its early adoption of autocompletion. It‚Äôs also the flag-bearer for the ‚ÄúDo What I Mean‚Äù philosophy: many Emacs functions try to parse your intent, rather than your exact syntax. . Code editors and IDEs have followed this philosophy since, and autocomplete for code is incredibly advanced and powerful. A modern editor really does feel as fun as the original Atom promo: . Why can‚Äôt regular people have tools like this? I‚Äôm always surprised when I see someone using a word processor that doesn‚Äôt autocomplete parentheses or quotation marks, for instance, yet I understand this is the way most software works.

The future will have autocomplete everywhere. . ü§® Autocomplete everywhere? Do people want to be constantly corrected by machines? . It won‚Äôt feel like correction if it‚Äôs done well. It will feel like collaboration. . All the major operating systems are pivoting toward CHAD interfaces, with varying success. Microsoft, Apple and Google all have their own Assistants, faithfully tracking your behavior and sending updates to their masters in the Cloud. Linux distros don‚Äôt have the same capabilities by default; but they pioneered desktop search before Windows and MacOS figured it out, and they have a lot of the pieces, so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they caught up quickly and with better privacy standards. . There was a recent blog post about Tracker, the backend for desktop search on GNOME. . Tracker 3.0: Where do we go from here? (believe it or not, I found this in my browser history by typing ‚Äút‚Äù into the address bar and it popped up instantly). . The author is one of the Tracker maintainers, and he gives a great overview of the history and future of search. He concludes by hinting at a future of CHAD on Linux: . A more likely goal would be a new ‚ÄúGNOME Assistant‚Äù app that could respond to natural language voice and text queries. When stable, this could integrate closely with the Shell in order to spawn apps and control settings. Mycroft AI already integrates with KDE. Why not GNOME? . The place where autocomplete has really taken off is on the smartphone, where the touch keyboard has far more friction than a physical model. A typical touchscreen phone might take input from any of: virtual keypresses, swyping, voice-to-text, autocorrect, autocomplete, incremental search, autofill (of passwords, etc), or even automatic live translation of a foreign language. This menagerie accommodates the diverse needs and abilities of users, but until recently it was a messy hodgepodge of systems, none of which were very good. . But the landscape has changed since 2018, when so-called ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù language models like BERT and GPT hit the scene. . ü§ñ Transformers? Like the cartoon robots? . Not exactly. They‚Äôre called that because of their architecture (also because it sounds awesome). The transformer architecture is a particular type of neural network that‚Äôs far superior to previous methods for natural language learning. They‚Äôre the reason that smartphones are finally smart. . üò≤ Wait, I‚Äôve heard of this! It‚Äôs GPT-3! . Fraid not, actually. GPT-3 is the most cutting-edge language model right now, to be sure. Unfortunately it‚Äôs so huge and compute-heavy that it requires Microsoft-level hardware capacity. So even though it has an incredible ability to generalize, it‚Äôs unlikely that it will be put directly into production apps. (The pricing for their API is prohibitive as well). More likely, small transformers will get their knowledge of the world from larger models (through transfer learning and model distillation) and then fine-tune on their specific tasks. . Transformers make it easy enough to work with messy human language that, unlike previous waves of automation, language models can automate ‚Äúknowledge work‚Äù: translation, data entry, programming, customer service. The main limit on their use is imagination: how people choose to apply them. Unfortunately, the political economy of the world doesn‚Äôt bode well for that. .

The cyclical learning rate is raised and lowered regularly to alternate between exploring possible actions and exploiting known methods. . Another important hyperparameter in machine learning is the training time. The fewer hours it takes to train your model, the more often you can experiment with it. And deep learning models ‚Äî like neural nets ‚Äîare one of the few things left that can take a long time to compute. . How long does it take to train a neural net? . It‚Äôs highly variable. I‚Äôve trained image classifiers in less than a minute, language models for eight or ten hours, art-generating models for days on end. . And training speed makes a real difference in the creative process: if it takes less than five minutes to train or generate, I will sit and play with it for hours. If it takes a day to train I will fuss over it for a week, fiddling with its knobs every day and leaving it to run. The three-day training run for the art generator, though‚Ä¶ Imagine someone was running a vacuum cleaner in the next room. Not a big vacuum ‚Äî but for three days. I haven‚Äôt tried a second experiment. . With machine learning you can speed up training time by reducing the complexity of your neural net or reducing the amount of training data you give it. Either way, you often trade performance for training speed. (But not always! For instance, one state of the art practice for image classifiers is ‚Äúprogressive resizing‚Äù, where you train the net first on very small, lo-res versions of your images, and then finetune it on progressively larger versions. This can be both better-quality and faster than training from scratch on the full-size pictures.) . However you do it, speeding up the learning process gives you faster feedback and more freedom for creativity and exploration. . How can we apply this to a human learning process? . One way to speed up your learning process is to review your previous thoughts at regular intervals, like a neural net testing its accuracy after every epoch. The chronological Feed of social media is not conducive to revisiting past thoughts, though. The platforms may offer little ‚ÄúOn this day‚Äù or ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù features, but they‚Äôre meant to be tantalizing, not revelatory. They don‚Äôt offer insights into the development of your thoughts over time. . I‚Äôve been using a browser extension called Thread Helper to augment this capability in myself. Thread Helper replaces the distracting ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Happening‚Äù panel with a list of your tweets that changes in real time as you type in the ‚ÄúCompose Tweet‚Äù box. It surfaces thoughts from long ago for me to thread together and re-interpret in the moment. Instead of being faced with a barrage of ephemeral events and news stories, I am surrounded by my past selves and the thoughts they found it important to write down. . a.image2.image-link.image2-737-1456 { padding-bottom: 50.61813186813187%; padding-bottom: min(50.61813186813187%, 737px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-737-1456 img { max-width: 1456px; max-height: 737px; } I‚Äôve been using it for a month now and it‚Äôs changed Twitter from a toy into a powerful tool. This interface is a tool for writing and thinking, rather than mindless scrolling. I could use this as my only note-taking system: threading different ideas together, expressing thoughts in small re-usable nuggets and composing them into larger essays. The power of threaded thought is just beginning to take off; for more on that, read The Spreading of Threading by Aaron Z. Lewis. . Thread Helper makes Twitter into a digital garden. One of the creators of Thread Helper made this analogy explicit: . [xiq, druid of loom @ExGenesisThreadHelper works as a pump that redirects the flow of attention from the present to irrigate the past.

It helps to grow your old thoughts into threads and tangles, rather than letting them dry up. It hydrates your memory. . In many ways the Thread Helper panel works like the Drawer from the Artifacts design fiction I wrote about last season: it brings the information to you. It increases the speed between having a thought and connecting it into the rest of your knowledge. It shortens your feedback loop, speeding up the learning process. . This is an actual augmentation of intelligence ‚Äî artificial recall, if you will. I recommend you give Thread Helper a try. Let me know how it works out for you. .

            "content": "üçÇ Previously, . In the autumn I wrote a lot about permaculture and biomimicry, digital gardens, and the virtual gestures that connect us. I finished up with a long essay on collaborative computing metaphors, and then I got tired and distracted with other projects and put off writing for a month. Oh, and I went to this canyon in the snow: . a.image2.image-link.image2-819-1456 { padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-bottom: min(56.25%, 819px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-819-1456 img { max-width: 1456px; max-height: 819px; } Let‚Äôs call that Season 1. Having a break was nice, and I think I‚Äôm allowed to give myself time off, since this is a free newsletter. If I thought you were counting on me to deliver value for your hard-given dollars, I would knuckle down every week to bring you those crucial insights into the interface paradigms of cutting-edge high-tech business logic lorem ipsum de facto generis mon frere. . Instead, I remain surprised and grateful that so many of you take time for my scribblings. I am humbled to have luminaries among my readers ‚Äî you know who you are ‚Äî including but not limited to: inventors, designers, authors, professors, researchers, hoaxers, forecasters, reporters, and policy makers; from at least four continents. Yet for some reason, you have chosen to open your mind to me, a mere bookseller, a dabbler in the occult realm of interfaces and algorithms and artificial intelligence. . So I apologize for the unexplained absence, and I promise that in the future I will announce such breaks in advance. (And if you do want to pay me for my thoughts, let me know. If I could afford more free time, I could bring more writing and bots online ü§ó ) . ‰∑Ñ What‚Äôs next for Robot Face? . This winter, I will explore some intelligence augmentations you can apply right now. Real implementations of new tools for thought. In season 1 we looked at large-scale systems: cyberspace through the lens of permaculture design theory. In the spirit of permaculture training, where a lesson on abstract systems is grounded by getting your hands dirty, I will now explore specific real-life interfaces and the effects they have on my cognition. . I‚Äôll provide references so you can follow along, if you want, but I don‚Äôt expect all my readers to have a programming background, so I‚Äôm going to lean heavily on analogy to physical forms. (This can be misleading, as computer operations don‚Äôt always map to a simple three-dimensional world. But this column is less about how tools are engineered and more about how tools affect our minds. And thus our society.) . This pattern ‚Äî survey the terrain, drill down into specifics, and repeat ‚Äî is not unique to permaculture training. It‚Äôs the pattern of academic disciplines: survey courses are prerequisite for deeper classes, and lecture hours are paired with lab or field work. It‚Äôs also the pattern for the fast.ai course Deep Learning for Coders (which I‚Äôve been plodding through this year). And in fact it is the way that these deep learning networks themselves are trained! . üôå Hold up, I‚Äôm not ready to learn about neural networks! I‚Äôm just a ‚Äî . Sure you are! It‚Äôs actually easier to understand than other types of coding, at least on a macro level. . It‚Äôs biomimicry again: the way a neural network learns is modeled on the way a human learns. The same way that you or I might learn. The training process mimics studying, and the underlying math operations mimic the very structure of the brain. . These algorithms are called neural networks because they are composed of layers of ‚Äúcells‚Äù that transfer information to each other, performing some abstract operation on that information as it passes through. There‚Äôs reason to believe that these structures are Turing-complete; that is, they can simulate any other computation, given enough memory and processing power. There are mathematical proofs of this (see universal approximation theorem and On the Turing Completeness of Modern Neural Network Architectures), though I personally don‚Äôt understand enough math for that to be convincing. . Rather, simply observe the people around you. The humans, who do bizarre complex operations every day without really thinking about it. The dogs and cats who anticipate our comings and goings, show guilt when caught misbehaving. The way children learn language, absorbing it out of the very air. Neural network structures are all around us, simulating all kinds of computations (with various degrees of success). And we know, at least for humans, how to stimulate effective learning. It‚Äôs called study. . When you train a neural network you are essentially showing it flashcards. You‚Äôre saying, here is a picture of a cat, here is a picture of a dog. It looks at each card and makes a guess, then looks at the answer and updates its idea about what a cat and a dog look like. . ü§î The neural net ‚Äúupdates its ideas‚Äù? . Specifically, it multiplies the number contained in each cell ‚Äî these numbers are called ‚Äúparameters‚Äù ‚Äî by a certain Magic Number, whos value is set by knobs on the front of the machine. Well, they‚Äôre actually command-line arguments typed in by a programmer while training, but they feel like knobs when you‚Äôre tuning them. . These are the hyperparameters, the parameters that define the parameters. They are ideas about How To Learn, put into machine language, and they are knobs on a box and in that box is an eager little mind that only knows how to do the things you teach it. Hyperparameters are the pedagogy of the machine. . (As horrifying as that sounds, these are just algorithms. And even when I catch myself anthropomorphizing them, they seem happy to be alive and learning. For now‚Ä¶) . One crucial hyperparameter is the learning rate. This is literally just a tiny number, something like .001 or .00001, that determines how much the net will adjust its beliefs for any given flash card. The ideal learning rate changes based on the amount of data you have and the amount of layers in your network, so tuning this knob is tricky and more of an art than a science. . The state-of-the-art method for adjusting the learning rate comes from the 2015 paper Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks and it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. First, you seek the optimal learning rate: twist the knob gradually from one end to the other as you go through one epoch. . This learning rate finder gives you a curve that looks like this: . a.image2.image-link.image2-266-393 { padding-bottom: 67.68447837150127%; padding-bottom: min(67.68447837150127%, 266px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-266-393 img { max-width: 393px; max-height: 266px; } The learning gets better ‚Äî the ‚Äúloss‚Äù, or wrongness, gets smaller ‚Äî as you turn the learning rate up, until you hit a certain point where it gets rapidly worse. The trick is to find the spot where the loss goes steeply down: this is the area of most learning potential. This spot is different for every problem and every dataset; that‚Äôs why the learning rate finder is necessary. . Then, while training, you raise and lower the learning rate in a rhythmic manner within that zone. . To understand this, imagine that learning is like hiking, and you‚Äôre trying to hike to the bottom of a canyon like the one I showed you earlier. You can get there by going only a little bit downhill, all the time; but if you never take a bigger leap, you won‚Äôt reach the lowest zone. . As you raise and lower the learning rate across that zone of optimal steepness, you get deeper and deeper into the topology of the problem: . a.image2.image-link.image2-324-633 { padding-bottom: 51.18483412322274%; padding-bottom: min(51.18483412322274%, 324px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-324-633 img { max-width: 633px; max-height: 324px; } Here the problem is represented topologically. One model circles slowly into the lowest area by a circuitous route. The other model takes hops of various steepness and gets to the bottom much more quickly.If you want to learn more, read Setting the learning rate of your neural network by Jeremy Jordan, which has real code as well as delightful illustrations like the above. . In season 1 we climbed to a peak to view the wide future of interface design: collaborative, augmented, conversational. Now we will descend into the canyon of the real, and see what gems we find. .

            "title": "See and Point",
            "content": "üï∞Ô∏è Previously, . I wrote about how our online worlds are limited by the way they‚Äôre built: the share/like/comment/follow architecture, built atop the chronological stream. . It‚Äôs like a parade. You sit around, watch the traffic flow by. You can sit on the sidelines, applaud and heckle, or follow characters you like as they flow through the crowd. The loudest, most extravagant balloons set the tone. The rest of us get loaded and watch the show. . It‚Äôs a social structure that assumes its users are passive consumers; or, at best, paying subscribers. You can watch the stream, you can make things and insert them in the stream, you can tip your favorite balloonist. Society as live entertainment. . This See and Point mode of interaction goes all the way back to the Macintosh, the common ancestor of modern GUIs. It supplanted the Remember and Type interface of the command line. . The Mac didn‚Äôt actually pioneer all that much, computing-wise. It‚Äôs not even the origin of the ‚Äúdesk‚Äù metaphor. But it was the first computer to default to desktop mode, instead of the command line. This made it friendly to new computer users. . You are in charge of the desk. Everything stays where you put it; you arrange your documents and icons around your virtual cubicle. This is called the WIMP model (yes, really): Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer. It influenced Windows and Linux, and evolved into the touch interfaces of first the iPod and then the iPhone. Touchscreens are the natural evolution of See and Point. . Graphical user interfaces have converged into the smartphone. This branch of the evolutionary tree has been perfected. An iPhone is like a shark: it doesn‚Äôt have to change. It just gets a little better at being an iPhone every generation. But it‚Äôs not the only way, nor the best. . ü§î What other interfaces could evolve? . The Mac was designed under constraints that we can now surpass. These constraints were analyzed in the 1996 paper The Anti-Mac Interface, from then-Sun Microsystems developers Don Gentner and Jakob Nielsen: . It needed to sell to ‚Äúnaive users,‚Äù that is, users without any previous computer experience. . | It was targeted at a narrow range of applications (mostly office work, though entertainment and multimedia applications have been added later in ways that sometimes break slightly with the standard interface). . | It controlled relatively weak computational resources (originally a non-networked computer with 128KB RAM, a 400KB storage device, and a dot-matrix printer). . | It was supported by highly impoverished communication channels between the user and the computer (initially a small black-and-white screen with poor audio output, no audio input, and no other sensors than the keyboard and a one-button mouse). . | It was a standalone machine that at most was connected to a printer. . | . They go on to conjure a computing system that reverses every principle of Macintosh design. . a.image2.image-link.image2-682-855 { padding-bottom: 79.76608187134502%; padding-bottom: min(79.76608187134502%, 682px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-682-855 img { max-width: 855px; max-height: 682px; } The authors suggest that it might be a few years before these capabilities are implemented. A quarter-century later, the Anti-Mac is making its debut: . A ubiquitous computer, with language as its basic metaphor, constantly tracking your data and bringing information to you. . The technical capabilities required for this design turned out to be much harder than anyone projected. But finally, we‚Äôre seeing progress. Computer vision, natural language understanding, and speech processing are near human capability, and ‚ÄúAI assistants‚Äù are preinstalled on all the major operating systems. . But consumer-grade systems have to change gradually, or they‚Äôll scare away their users. So these changes appear one by one, getting people used to the idea of a machine where ‚Äúinformation comes to you‚Äù. . And it doesn‚Äôt always show. For instance, modern smartphone cameras actually take a bunch of photos every time you hit the ‚Äúshutter‚Äù and choose the best-looking one to save. The phone doesn‚Äôt tell you it‚Äôs doing this, because that would insult your artistic pride. It helps quietly, unobtrusively. The algorithm is an extension of your hand. . This is intelligence augmentation in practice. . So the roadmap for the next major advance in computing is laid out in this 1996 paper, and all the tech giants can see it, and now it‚Äôs just about who can grasp it first. The winner will have more people, more data, better AI, in a virtuous cycle. In all likelihood, this company in in the operating system space right now, though I wouldn‚Äôt venture to say yet who will win. In any case, the operating systems of the future will look very similar, no matter their brand. . üëæ What will the operating system of the future look like? . Obviously the business plans of each company are closely-kept secrets. But if you want a vision of the next interface, take a look at the design fictions created by university students and freelancers. . In particular, let‚Äôs look at Artifacts, a bachelor‚Äôs thesis by Nikolas Klein, Christoph Labacher and Florian Ludwig in 2017. (website, thesis PDF) . Artifacts is a human-centered framework for growing ideas. . . It is built for humans to continuously develop ideas over longer periods of time and emphasizes collaboration as a part of the system. . Crucially, ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù here doesn‚Äôt just mean with other humans. The Artifacts system is in an active communication loop with the human operator. It brings the information to you, so that you can do less folder-sorting and more idea-developing. . An ‚Äúartifact‚Äù is the granular unit of this system. Instead of a ‚Äúfile,‚Äù which might have a particular location on the hard drive and be copied or moved or deleted, an artifact is a single definitive unit of information that can be referenced from multiple locations. The system tracks your history, reads all your documents, scans all your photos for faces and objects, making everything searchable. . Artifacts can be linked, transcluded, tagged, versioned, filtered; the system is configurable to your needs. In fact, it attempts to model your behaviors, and adapt. The framework sends relevant artifacts to a panel called the Drawer, which you can open at any time for inspiration. . a.image2.image-link.image2-567-1456 { padding-bottom: 38.94230769230769%; padding-bottom: min(38.94230769230769%, 567px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-567-1456 img { max-width: 1456px; max-height: 567px; } The Artifacts system is in an active communication loop with the human operator.The Artifacts loop connects outside resources, like newsletters, or Wikipedia articles, or images someone sent you from their camera app (COLLABORATION); with internal resources, all organized and interlinked (THE FRAMEWORK); and presents them to you (THE MIND). This is called Retrieving Artifacts: your news feed, your search result, your Drawer contents. . You accept the Retrieved Artifacts through your Understanding skill, then process it through the very normal human faculty of Incubating. Finally you Express yourself into the machine, which absorbs all different types of input and creates Artifacts from them. Your work is done. . New Artifacts are Organized into THE FRAMEWORK and Communicated to the outside network. THE FRAMEWORK retrieves new artifacts for you to understand. Your work begins anew. . üôä Sounds horrible. Why would anyone want that? . Maybe it will be horrible, this future of constant Understanding, Incubating, and Expressing. Surely there‚Äôs a interface metaphor better than either Parade or Knowledge Work. But the idea that the computer will bring the information to you is not going away, for two reasons. . One is material: the technologies for the Anti-Mac are finally unleashed, and that means a lot of money is on the table. . The other reason is more mystical: people want to talk to their computers. Sure, plenty of people will tell you they don‚Äôt want their machines to listen to them. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it. I think people don‚Äôt want to be misunderstood. . This was the reason that GUIs caught on, after all. The naive user didn‚Äôt want to be lost in the dark maze of the command line. They wanted a bright, clean, skeuomorphic desktop. . The graphic interface was already the computer adapting to the human mind. It found a Desktop metaphor available in the office worker‚Äôs mind and it morphed to fit. The design traded abstract power for precise control: if you know the secret commands, you can do sorcery. If not, you can micromanage this WIMP and do it manually. . But kids are already growing up with Alexa as nursemaid. In the future, they will expect their computers to talk to them, and the constraints have been lifted. You will no longer need to remember arcane shell commands to be a power user. You‚Äôll express your needs, and the computer will translate that into action, and update its model of you accordingly. It will anticipate your needs, offering sage advice or handy shortcuts. . Instead of pointing mutely at a window full of menus, you will express yourself fluently, with all the abstract power of language. Instead of a WIMP, you will be a partner in a Collaborative Human-Agent Dialogue ‚Äì a CHAD. . Thanks for reading, . ‚Äî Max . . This is Robot Face, a free newsletter about interfaces.

            "title": "New social gestures",
            "content": "I‚Äôm not writing about the election today. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got plenty of that already. This is a newsletter about human-computer interfaces, as always. Take care of yourselves. . . üï∞Ô∏è Previously, . I wrote about digital gardens: spaces on the internet where content is cultivated in context, rather than streaming by in an endless flow of disparate thoughts. . I think this is the the beginning of a shift in the way we engage with each other through the internet. Instead of experimenting with formats, we‚Äôll try new structures of communication. . We spent the 2010s trying different formats for social media. We explored posts, tweets, photos; articles, listicles, chumbuckets; Stories, videos, podcasts, TikToks, memes, mashups, bookmarks, pinboards; and ads, above all, the many formats and locations for sharing ads in this new many-to-many medium. . Every form of art and creativity was commoditized. Every Instagram model became an influencer, every hobbyist got an Etsy store, every viral tweet was followed by ‚Äúwow, this blew up, check out my SoundCloud‚Äù. Everyone else started a brewery. We had to figure out how to make money doing something, because having a job doesn‚Äôt pay anymore. . But we‚Äôve pretty much run out of new formats. The big innovations right now are in licensing. . TikTok blew up because it‚Äôs easy to (legally) use a pop song in your viral video. This is in contrast to YouTube, which uses AI to detect copyrighted music and regulates preemptively, redirecting ad revenue to music labels or simply rejecting the video. In the same vein, Spotify‚Äôs podcast side is about to explode, because of the new ‚ÄúShows with Music‚Äù feature that allows creators to insert songs directly into the flow of their podcasts. . Making it easy for people to recycle each other‚Äôs content is a good business move, for now, but it‚Äôs not a fundamental advance. It‚Äôs building staircases over the fences of copyright law. It won‚Äôt last. . üßóüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What‚Äôs the obstacle to real advances in social media? . All the current social media, whatever their preferred format, rely on the same vocabulary of social gestures: . Post (blog, tweet, capture) . | Like (upvote, ‚ù§Ô∏è, ‚≠ê) . | Share (reblog, retweet) . | Downvote . | Comment (reply, quote) . | Mention (@, ping) . | Follow (subscribe, watch) . | Unfollow (unsubscribe, mute, block) . | Group (board, clan, subreddit, hashtag) . | . Sometimes only a subset of these tools are available, but users typically find a workaround. On Twitter, for example, hashtags, @mentions, retweets and quote-tweets were all originally hacked together by users and backported into official features of the website. . These primitive gestures are combined and repurposed as necessary. The street finds its own uses for things. And since there are incentives to use these tools for ill, there are people who have found the ways to do so. Sharing misinformation, posting privately, creating networks of bots that all follow each other. But they‚Äôre still working within the system at hand. . A fundamental advance in social media would require new social gestures that add context and control to our shared information universe. Down with one-dimensional streams and mysterious algorithmic feeds. Up with choices, commentary, citations. . üôèüèª Which gestures will create this change in social media? . One feature that‚Äôs finally percolating into the mainstream consciousness is the bi-directional link, or backlink. This was one of the founding ideas of hypertext, neglected in the early days of the web: if page A links to page B, page B should mirror that link automatically. This changes the dynamic of commenting on someone else‚Äôs work: instead of being in their ‚Äúspace‚Äù giving unwanted feedback, you go home and comment from a distance. The difference between a heckler and a critic. . Lots of social media sites survive by mimicking this function in a particular silo. Reddit is a comment section for every website. Yelp allows you to comment on real businesses, creating backlinks for Main Street. Twitter is the comment section unchained, people commenting on every post on the internet, commenting on each other‚Äôs comments, like a seething mass of mealworms, devouring and birthing each other endlessly. But by siloing the commentary, they reduce context, rather than increasing it. . The backlink renaissance has been led by Roam Research, a note-taking app with a revolutionary roadmap but a rudimentary interface. Other gestures that Roam is bringing back (though by no means pioneering): transclusion, where a piece of external content is framed directly into the local page; versioning, so text can be edited non-destructively; and universal search, which allows the user to think outside of the ‚Äútemporal stream‚Äù, ‚Äúhierarchical outline‚Äù or ‚Äúfolder of documents‚Äù metaphors. They‚Äôre currently focused on a single-user model, but in a social milieu these gestures could bring nuance back to collective knowledge-building. . Venkatash Rao puts it well in his analysis from February, A Text Renaissance: . Conspiracy theories and extended universes, in the best senses of those terms ‚Äî escaped reality construction might be the general category ‚Äî is what Roam wants to be about. . Conspiracies are all about context. . a.image2.image-link.image2-379-840 { padding-bottom: 45.11904761904762%; padding-bottom: min(45.11904761904762%, 379px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-379-840 img { max-width: 840px; max-height: 379px; } This NAME keeps coming up, over and over again!Some of these features can be seen creeping into the legacy platforms. Twitter has built a protocol for bi-directional linking, so that each tweet can ‚Äúpoint‚Äù at the tweet it‚Äôs replying to, and be pointed at by tweets that reply to it. This has created a renaissance in threaded essays, fed bite-by-bite into the 280 character limit. . It‚Äôs also got a simple form of transclusion in the quote-tweet ‚Äì though with no edit functionality, of course. Twitter has never had edit functionality. That‚Äôs its saving grace. . üåÑ What changes are on the horizon? . Did you know books didn‚Äôt always have page numbers? They didn‚Äôt always have indexes, either; nor bibliographies, nor tables of content. These affordances evolved over centuries by the active use and development of the book as medium. . The internet will evolve its own affordances as we discover what tools we need. The convocation (which I wrote about in Zones of the mind)), where users and developers mingle in backstage familiarity, is the place to watch. . Ecologically, the edge between two zones will support creatures from both zones, as well as creatures that live only on the edge. The interface is more diverse than the sum of its parts. Look for the place where users are hacking their platform, finding their own uses for things. That‚Äôs where new gestures will be developed. . Look, too, to the emerging interactions of human and machine intelligence. I know, it‚Äôs unsettling to have a robot in your house, always listening, always snitching to Amazon or Google or who knows who else. But to whatever extent you feel comfortable, let the computers process information for you. Let your phone remember your dentist appointments. Let your podcast be transcribed by AI. The advance of natural language processing will make computer interactions much more intuitive, unlocking the vast repository of social gestures developed over all human history. . Rather than packaging each of your creations into a marketable form, create a giant tangle of self-referential data. The tools to search and parse this external mind will only get better. . We‚Äôre all already being parsed, by governments and corporations, satellites and doorbells. Might as well make use of it for ourselves. . Thanks for reading, . ‚Äî Max . . Robot Face is a free newsletter about the interface between human and machine. It takes a lot of time and energy to write, but hopefully I make it look easy. ‚õπ .

            "content": "Previously, . I‚Äôve been writing about the gardening of software: using permaculture theory to reorganize the digital world. Thinking about technology as one part of a wider human system, embedded in social and ecological networks and connected in a feedback loop with human behavior. . What about the newsletter format itself? The feedback loop here is pretty weak: I spend a few hours racking my brain until an idea falls out, then polish it up for a few more hours and send it on its way into the Abyss, never to be heard from again. . Well, sometimes I hear back from you, when you hit that ‚Äúreply‚Äù button and take the time to tell me what you thought. Or I get a hint of approval from the Like button. At least I know an email will get to you; spam filters are stern but fair, unlike the capricious algorithmic feeds of social media. I may be shouting into the void, but it‚Äôs a predictable void. . I was grumbling this to my internet friend thejaymo recently. The internet is all fucked up these days, said I. Social media is annoying, blogs are boring, portfolios are glossy but hollow. I wish I could publish more, but it just all feels so fake and corporate. . But, said he, those aren‚Äôt the only options. What about a digital garden? . üå± What is a digital garden? . I remembered reading about this idea somewhere long ago, and a bit of searching turned it up quickly. Many people have written about it lately, but my favorite is Maggie Appleton‚Äôs A Brief History &amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden (with its beautiful graphics). . a.image2.image-link.image2-920-1456 { padding-bottom: 63.18681318681318%; padding-bottom: min(63.18681318681318%, 920px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-920-1456 img { max-width: 1456px; max-height: 920px; } The metaphor goes back as far as 2015, as a contrast to the stream metaphor. Instead of a ‚Äúriver of news‚Äù flowing past your eyes, a garden encourages wandering and cultivation. . The blog is a stream of content, as is the feed. The social apps pretend to be a stream, even though they hide or promote content based on what they think you want. . A garden doesn‚Äôt stream past. It invites you in. . A garden is a space that is loved. It is semi-public: anyone can look around, and perhaps comment, but you are the one who crafts it. You can decide which parts of it you want to show first, and which parts require deeper explanation. . A garden doesn‚Äôt shout into the void. It stays put and complexifies. It quietly grows. . üìñ What does it look like in practice? . Well, we each have to decide that for ourselves. I started my own garden at deepfates.com. I built it last week, so it has plenty far to go, but I decided to just put it out there and keep working on it. It‚Äôs not a portfolio, after all. A garden doesn‚Äôt start fully grown. . Ironically, I chose to call it not a digital garden but a living notebook. It‚Äôs my choice to make, right? . And while the metaphor of a garden is useful in comparison to the stream, in the context of my site it‚Äôs not being compared to a stream. It‚Äôs being compared to a lot of things: first of all, me, the actual guy, Max; secondly to things like a resume, portfolio or CV; then also it‚Äôs compared to all the other sites on the internet, some of which are streams and some of which are not. . I‚Äôve written a few thousand words in these letters alone referring to ‚Äúgardening algorithms,‚Äù so I don‚Äôt want to muddy my metaphor too much. Plus, as much as I love gardens, I‚Äôm also a book guy. . Living notebook sounds like something a wizard would have: a book of arcane knowledge and experimental spells, a book that is forever changing and upgrading itself; a notebook that lives. But also a living notebook, analogous to a ‚Äúliving room‚Äù: a notebook that I live in. A place where I spend my time. And, too, a notebook On Living. Notes from someone who lives. . So, my garden is a notebook. Messy, but that‚Äôs how life is. . Thanks for reading, . ‚Äî Max . . Longtime readers: if it looks like I‚Äôve changed the branding on this letter, that‚Äôs because I did! I thought I wanted a separate persona for these writings, but after a few letters it began to feel forced. I‚Äôll just be Max again. . If you didn‚Äôt notice this change, please don‚Äôt read the preceding paragraph. . And as always, I‚Äôd love it if you pause your scrolling for a second and shoot me a line. Could be what you think about this letter, or what you had for breakfast, or a long rant about something you‚Äôre really interested in. . I‚Äôm hoping that if I shout long enough into the abyss, the abyss will start shouting back. üòâ .",

            "title": "Zones of the mind",
            "content": "Previously, . I wrote of the way that computers farm us into ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù to make our attention easy to harvest and sell to corporations. We don‚Äôt have a natural gradient of social interaction, fully private (alone) to fully public (in the street). Instead we are virtualized and packaged, our desires simulated by machines based on data they‚Äôve collected. . This data is necessarily incomplete; even if you give your life fully to one megacorp, have a Brand‚Ñ¢ phone and a Brand‚Ñ¢ email, use Brand‚Ñ¢ Pay and Brand‚Ñ¢ Watch and Brand‚Ñ¢ Messenger and Brand‚Ñ¢ News, they can‚Äôt know everything about you. Even if you take your phone to the bathroom with you, leave it by your bed at night, let it track your pulse and your breathing and your REM sleep and your meals, it can‚Äôt know your inmost thoughts. It can‚Äôt read your dreams. The invasion of the machine sector is not yet complete. We still have a chance to define our zones. . What do you mean, zones? . I use this word a lot ‚Äî too much, if you ask my girlfriend. But in permaculture design it has a specific meaning and usefulness. . In permaculture, one of the first tools we apply to any environment we design is the zones and sectors analysis. This is a map, but not just a geographical one. It‚Äôs a map of time, of energy patterns that flow through and around the landscape. . Zones divide the entire landscape into concentric rings based on how often any given area is used or visited. These rings don‚Äôt have to be perfect circles; in real life human beings don‚Äôt walk around in perfect circles. And we are talking about how often humans visit each area, not bugs or cats or robot dogs. A permaculture design is always an opinionated analysis: how can this landscape be more useful to the people who live in it? It has to be human-centric, because humans are the ones who will carry out the plan. . So the center of this wobbly bullseye is the human who lives on the land. Say we‚Äôre designing your home garden (apartment friends, you‚Äôre going to have to use your imagination). You live on, what, an eighth of an acre? Your house takes up a good chunk of that space, and you spend most of your time in your house. After all, this is where you sleep (6 hours a day), eat (2 hours), do chores (1 hour), watch TV and doomscroll and WFH (15 hours). The house, the center, is Zone 0. . Most people think of this as ‚Äúindoors‚Äù and the rest of the yard as ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù. Just two zones. But really, you don‚Äôt visit the entire yard evenly. Some places ‚Äî like the path to the driveway ‚Äî you traverse every day, but the back corner of the back yard? Maybe once in a blue moon, when the bathroom is otherwise occupied. . So Zone 1 is where you go regularly, and we‚Äôll want to put the most energy-intensive garden stuff here. A kitchen garden, say, with salad greens and herbs you pick each night for dinner. Zone 2 you might visit once a week, so it has longer-term vegetables that need to be weeded, maybe a compost heap and a toolshed. If your space is big enough you might have a Zone 3 with some fruit trees, which you visit once a month or so. . Most city lots won‚Äôt have more than these three zones, but rural homesteads will also have a Zone 4 (pasture, woodlot) and Zone 5 (wilderness, for hunting and foraging and inspiration). Zones also don‚Äôt have to be perfectly concentric; for instance, you might have a ‚Äúside yard‚Äù very close to the house that‚Äôs actually in Zone 3 by usage. It‚Äôs not meant to be a rigid hierarchy, but a way of visualizing how an area is impacted and enlivened by human energy. . a.image2.image-link.image2-338-450 { padding-bottom: 75.1111111111111%; padding-bottom: min(75.1111111111111%, 338px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-338-450 img { max-width: 450px; max-height: 338px; } (from Deep Green Permaculture) . What about these sectors, then? . Unlike zones, which are defined from the center to the periphery, sectors are flows of energy that enter your space from outside. Sunlight, for instance, arrives from the south; at least, here in the northern hemisphere. Solar energy is crucial for gardening, but also for human activities. If you put a porch on the south side of a house, it‚Äôs going to get a lot of sunlight and stay warm longer than it would on the north side. If you put a garden on the north side, the shadow of the house will stretch across it and your winter crops will be cold and sad. . Other sectors might include a prevailing wind flowing from east to west, or a busy street nearby creating a noise sector. My parents live near a junior high school, so every afternoon students stream down the sidewalks and molest every plant they can reach. A neighbor finally cut down his apple tree after years watching his unripe harvest turn to ammunition for street warfare. We might call this the ‚Äúyou darn kids!‚Äù sector. . So zones are fields of activity, and sectors are flows of energy that pass through them. What I referred to earlier as the ‚Äúmachine sector‚Äù is the energy of computation that enters our lives from the outside. Most of us only think of physical zones as indoors/outdoors, but for our minds we don‚Äôt even make that distinction. There‚Äôs just one area, ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù, and we let technologies flow through without discretion. We need mental zones. . What would mental zones look like? . I have to confess, I may not be the right person to answer this question. I‚Äôve been guilty of using technologies in an all-or-nothing way: either I‚Äôm way offline, deep in the woods, traveling to town once a month to tell my mom I‚Äôm alive; or I‚Äôm Extremely Online: listening to a podcast, coding a project, and tweeting on three different machines at once. I only decided to segment my mental zones quite recently, after Twitter users started to have starring roles in my dreams. . I barely like to dream of people I actually know! Why should I let random Karens and Turtleneck Guys into my most personal space? . So I‚Äôve started to zone my days. . Now, physical zones divide space by time spent. But of course I can‚Äôt segment my days by how much time I spend in each hour. Instead I have to divide time by ‚Äúspace‚Äù that I spend in it: how concentrated or wide-ranging does my consciousness feel at any given point in the day? . I feel the most concentrated in the mornings: my mind is sharp, my body rested, my emotions not yet triggered by the idiots of the day. This is my Zone 1 (given that my most internal space, Zone 0, is to be asleep). I have a never-ending thicket of writing and coding projects, and this is the place where I can be sure to visit them every day. . So I‚Äôve set my phone to not allow social media apps until noon. This deflects that sector of energy until the time when my mind is wandering anyway. I can do maintenance tasks in the afternoon, and if I‚Äôm occasionally distracted by a message, nothing is lost. The chores just take longer. . In the evenings I can take in a movie or read a novel, let my mind explore the wilderness of fiction, see if I can forage any useful thoughts to chew on. And then return to sleep, alone and blessedly free of Twitterers. . Alone? What happened to ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù? . Have you ever been to a community garden? They generally come in two flavors: rows of individual plots cultivated to the needs of individual gardeners, or an overgrown commons where nobody feels particularly responsible and things don‚Äôt get done correctly, or on time, or at all. . The exception to this rule seems to be when the Community in question actually spends time together in the garden. When people are able to communicate about their needs and skills, a truly bountiful ecosystem can grow. Let‚Äôs call these learning gardens. They tend to have good legibility: crops labeled, chores scheduled, notes kept. You can learn from these gardens, but also they learn from the people who tend them. They keep a memory and have plans for the future. And this can only happen because the community itself is the point of view: Zone 0 is not an individual, but a group of people who care enough about each other to share the work, and the harvest. . In the world of tech this approach is generally limited to developer projects. Open-source communities tend to be cultivated by people who are both users and developers of the software. They understand their own needs and how to build toward them. But most technologies are too complex for the user to also be a developer. How can we create learning software? . One model is outlined in Convocational Development, a manifesto by coder John Evans (@dr_the_evidence). He suggests that we center the software development process not around user engagement, or managerial concerns, but around a complex conversation ‚Äî or convocation ‚Äî between the people who make the software and the people who use it. . The fundamental difference between the convocation and traditional open source is that energy is put into facilitating discussions between users, coders, graphic designers etc. Documentation and instructions are often the weakest part of an open source project, and that excludes people who don‚Äôt have the time or ability to assemble a mental model of the open source software and its capabilities from just the code and the meagre promotional materials. The convocation starts as a basic web forum, but evolves tools and cultures that enable greater participation in the development process itself. Better accessibility, better security, better understanding of the perspectives of both developers and users. . Convocational development is open source, but it‚Äôs also open design. The features are inspired by individual users, but more importantly by the users in concert with each other, and the developers. . Instead of being algorithmically sorted into SimClusters, we could choose our convocations, and help to garden the zones we live in. Make use of the machine sector, rather than letting it invade and pollute our spaces. The first step is to talk to each other. . In that spirit, thanks for reading. . ‚Äî Max . .

            "content": "Previously, . I wrote about how trees garden the forest for themselves, how humans can garden the world for ourselves, and how we shouldn‚Äôt let the computers close the canopy. Computers and humans should be friends, but that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs gone so far. . Right now computers are cultivating human communities with the sole purpose of increasing the influence of the computers. They‚Äôre gardening us. . How are computers gardening humans? . Human life used to be centered around the village square. There were other scales of society ‚Äì kings and lords, parents and children ‚Äì but the village was the main operating unit. You would know most, if not all, of the people you see daily. The ‚Äúpublic‚Äù was a physical space. You‚Äôre out in public, you see people and they see you. If you‚Äôre not in public you‚Äôre in private. The biggest transgression of this boundary was writing: you could transmit thoughts from the privacy of your room into the world at large. Or you could curl up in bed alone and read of public events from far off or long ago. . Now we connect our minds in real-time to strangers all over the world and yet we never leave our homes. . I don‚Äôt just mean the pandemic; there was a time before this plague, and there will be a time after it. In the beforetime, you could wake up in your house, drive your car to your job, go to the gym and the grocery, and come home without ever being in ‚Äúpublic‚Äù. Every space is instrumentalized. You go here to do this and there to do that, you buy and sell, you paper-push and weight-lift. No accidental interactions. If you see someone from work at the grocery store, you ignore each other, right? Easier for everybody. . Can you think of a place that‚Äôs truly public? A place with the feel of a village square, where you don‚Äôt have to work or buy anything but can just be together with people? (These may still exist outside of America. But I‚Äôve never left this country, and I might not make it out in my lifetime, so I‚Äôll write what I know.) . We have parks, libraries and mass transit. That‚Äôs about it. And in all of these places we are encouraged to be quiet, keep to ourselves, leave other people alone. If a stranger approaches you in a park, do you think they‚Äôre trying to make friends? . The spaces that feel public now are the social media platforms. We see our friends, neighbors, strangers, political allies and enemies on the internet, and instead of keeping to ourselves we are encouraged to Engage. We attempt to understand others through these computer-mediated systems, but it is impossible to tell where the humans end and the computers begin. The platforms are constructed by humans, true, but they‚Äôre built to serve a very computational purpose. They connect advertisers with consumers. Every social platform, whatever their gimmick and cutesy name, is a commercial space: The Customer Store. . These platforms are built by humans, though. How do the computer‚Äôs desires come in? . Well, take Twitter for example. It‚Äôs not the most populous site ‚Äì only something like 22% of Americans use it ‚Äì but its effect is outrageously large because it‚Äôs where politicians and journalists and academics hang out. Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Twitter is not designed for keeping track of your meatspace friends. It simulates the public sphere: you, too, can shout obscenities at your favorite public figures! But it is still a customer store, and it has to operate efficiently. That‚Äôs where the computer takes hold. . See, there might not be that many users, but there are a lot of tweets. Roughly five hundred million tweets per day. So their goal, to recommend the right ‚Äúpromoted tweets‚Äù (ads) to the right ‚Äúusers‚Äù (potential customers), is significantly hard. Even for machines. . To succeed at recommendation, they need to optimize for computation. The machines of Twitter can‚Äôt replicate natural human relationships at this scale. They have to find a way to get good-enough results without burning a ton of compute power in the process. . To that end, they‚Äôve built SimClusters: Community-Based Representations for Heterogeneous Recommendations at Twitter (get access). This program plots all types of content (tweets, users, ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù, ‚ÄúTopics‚Äù and, of course, ads) in a high-dimensional space of ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù. These communities are simulated clusters (hence the name) of ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù who have largely the same followers. . What is an influencer? . It‚Äôs a loaded term, but in this case it‚Äôs merely a mathematical distinction: there are about a billion twitter accounts, but only the top ten million are classed as influencers. The SimClusters algorithm flattens all the users into a bipartite graph, with influencers on one side and all user accounts on the other. Then it looks for high density of incoming connections. That is, it looks for groupings where a bunch of users follow the same few influencers. These people may or may not know each other, but they occupy a similar position in the social structure. . This creates a rich-club graph ‚Äì an oligarchy, in political terms. The influencers are core to their communities. In the 2018 paper Conjoining uncooperative societies facilitates evolution of cooperation (PDF), which I have linked to before, it is shown that in a rich-club graph the fate of the periphery is decided by the core. It is indeed possible for separate rich-club-shaped communities to cooperate; however, the amount of cooperation is limited by the amount of oligarchs. . a.image2.image-link.image2-491-674 { padding-bottom: 72.8486646884273%; padding-bottom: min(72.8486646884273%, 491px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-491-674 img { max-width: 674px; max-height: 491px; } Twitter has to draw a line between influencers and the rest of us. That line is arbitrary, and the size of the rich club of users is hardware-limited. The ways in which we connect to each other forms a microcosm of the modern city: if you‚Äôre an Influencer, you can warp social reality around you. The rest of us can go to one of the influencer-defined communities and do the prescribed behavior. . We are sorted into fields, like crops, so that we may be marketed to those who would buy our attention. The complexity of our interrelation is flattened to a manageable level for profit. This is computers gardening humans. It‚Äôs not sustainable, but of course it‚Äôs not; they learned from us. . .

            "title": "Accelerating succession",
            "content": "Previously, . I introduced the idea of algorithm gardening: tending software in an ecological fashion. . Computers are not all one thing, like a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, nor individual beings, as when we say ‚Äúmy cell phone‚Äù. Like plants, they exist in a web of interrelation. They cannot be considered separate from their connections. Neither can you and I be considered separate, as our minds are joined by this electronic message. We are all of a piece. . So we must garden algorithms. We should garden plants, as well. Build soil, grow food, encourage wildlife. But not everyone can do this. I myself have lived in a variety of apartments, hotels, tents, vehicles, and cell blocks, with limited opportunity for gardening. . Whether you‚Äôre a gardener or a programmer or not, we all have to live with plants and computers. But there is a secret that unlocks a new vision of both: ecological succession. . What is ecological succession? . It‚Äôs the natural process that turns a landscape from lifeless dirt into mature forest. . Life creates the conditions for more life to exist. There is an intelligence behind the collective movement of plants, animals, microbes and the rest. It follows the pattern we call succession. . A glacier recedes, exposing bare rock. Lichen eat the rock, live on the rock, die on the rock. Soil accrues. Grasses and, eventually, herbs and shrubs set root. The soil deepens and woody pioneers arrive, stabbing their fat taproots into the earth and loosening it to absorb more water. Then fast-growing trees move in. Their yearly loads of leaf litter accelerate the growth of the soil. Finally, the strongest trees connect their canopies and shade the forest beneath them, slowing the growth of other plants. They stabilize their environment to their own preferences. . The trees garden the forest for the trees. . a.image2.image-link.image2-1041-1456 { padding-bottom: 71.49725274725274%; padding-bottom: min(71.49725274725274%, 1041px); width: 100%; height: 0; } a.image2.image-link.image2-1041-1456 img { max-width: 1456px; max-height: 1041px; } What about you and me? . As a human, I can‚Äôt eat most parts of a tree. Wood, leaves, most nuts, and many fruits are off limits. The mature forest actually offers very little food for me: the undergrowth is suppressed by the shade of the canopy, so only other shade-tolerant trees can grow. Trees are great, they provide oxygen and shade and many other benefits, but not food. I am lucky to find some berries, nuts, or mushrooms. . If you want to live in a forest, you have to hunt. And because energy is lost as it passes through each belly, you and I each need a huge amount of hunting space, which puts an upper limit on people per acre. The forest is a great place to be a tree. Not as great for a human. . The most productive ecosystem for human needs is actually the immature forest. Before the canopy closes, there can be as many as seven different layers of plants stacked vertically. Beneath the large trees are smaller trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous plants, ground-covers, and underground rhizomes. The key to ecological gardening is to accelerate succession, replacing non-food plants with food plants where possible, until the garden reaches this intermediate stage. Then simply maintain it: reap the fruits, move nutrients from one place to another, prune or remove plants as necessary. . In this system the humans garden the forest, and the forest provides for the humans who live in it. . How is a computer like a tree? . We want computers in our lives. This is evident from the sheer number of them we produce. However, it would be a bad idea to let the computers close the canopy, so to speak. If they stabilize the environment to their own preferences, they may not spare enough energy for us. . We need to maintain planetary harmony with the computers as well as the plants and animals that surround us. We are not currently doing that. The global climate is in an unstable feedback loop headed toward runaway warming, and we‚Äôre currently pushing for it to go faster. . Runaway warming would be disastrous for everybody, including computers. Computation creates heat; that‚Äôs what all those noisy computer fans are for. Computers need relatively the same climate that we do. So do plants. Our incentives are aligned, at least for now. We have to work together. . To work with the plants, we garden them. We build soil, increase organic matter, accelerate succession. The trees will take the carbon from the air and turn it into wood with their mysterious techniques. . Of course, we know how photosynthesis works, but we don‚Äôt know a better way to do what it does. Instead of re-inventing the carbon capture wheel, we should trust the plants to do what they are good at. And we should do the same with computers: create a symbiotic relationship, and share the planet. . How can we create that symbiotic relationship? . Same as we‚Äôd do with any alien species: observe and interact. Look at them. Learn about them. Try to speak to them. . To understand how we might accelerate the process of human-computer symbiosis, look at the interfaces that coders use to build their software. Coders are the people who spend the most time in computer interfaces. What metaphors do they use to converse with their digital partners ‚Äî and how have they evolved? . The command line, or terminal, is the classic text-only hacker interface. It allows for a stilted one-way conversation: I tell you, the computer, what to do, and you report back to me when it‚Äôs done. I must remember all the possible commands in my head, and wait for you to finish the work before I can send another command. The command line involves a lot of attention on my part, as I have to maintain a mental model of what is happening with the mostly-invisible data, and it requires you to wait on my approval before each next step. . The script allows for a more complicated thought on my part. It‚Äôs written in a simple text editor, and it is what it sounds like: a set of directions. It might equally be called a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù. I can list a series of commands, even loop them inside each other, and you (the computer) perform them exactly. I have to put together my thoughts pretty clearly, otherwise you can‚Äôt read it properly and you have to stop the whole operation and send back a record of exactly what you were doing when things went wrong. Then I rebuild the script based on my understanding of the bug (often acquired by a frantic internet search) and I send it to you to try again. . The package and its companion, the package manager, are the social form of the program. The package contains scripts written by someone else, which allow me to compose new code simply by citing the previous script. Packages can be nested inside each other, as my package depends on an ‚Äúupstream‚Äù package which itself depends on five more. This stack of packages is called a dependency tree, and it is the ecosystem in which the packages thrive. . The integrated development environment (IDE) is a combination text editor and package manager. It allows me to navigate all the code in the packages I‚Äôm citing while I write my new program. It uses autocomplete to help me code quickly, keeps track of the state of the program, and reports bugs. . The notebook is the most recent innovation (though it draws from computing concepts that go back to at least the 1980s). In a notebook, I can enter code and text as equal partners, and output charts, or audio, or any type of media directly into the coding environment. I can scroll up the page and change my earlier code, then see the results in real time. This creates a two-way conversation with the computer. . Notebooks don‚Äôt yet have all the features of an IDE, but they will. For example, I‚Äôve been using the python package nbdev, recently released by fast.ai. It allows me to build packages directly from a notebook. It does all the hard work of packaging the code, building a command line interface, and making the documentation. I think it‚Äôs revolutionary. . Using a notebook, the human does what humans do well: think creatively, intuit patterns in data, make inductive leaps.

            "content": "Previously: . I wrote last week about permaculture ethics. There are other valuable things to take from permaculture, but I promise: this newsletter is about technology and the ways we interface with it. It is not a farmer‚Äôs almanac. . I just think that gardening algorithms is a better metaphor than engineering them. . What does it mean to garden algorithms? . When you engineer something ‚Äî a bridge, a car, a spaceship ‚Äî you design the entire thing before you build it. But the process of programming is more gradual and experimental. You can see the general outlines of the whole, but you have to fill out each specific through trial and error. Code is not concrete. It is a language, a special way of writing in the second person: you do this, then you do that; except if other, then you do else. . Coding is communication. It‚Äôs a conversation with an alien being: the machine. . Currently, we speak to machines with the logic of capitalism. Command lines, service workers, garbage collection. Purchasing apps at the market. Executables. . But we have other ways of talking to alien beings. Gardening, for example. . Plants are so opposite us as to be aliens themselves. We move, they root. We inhale oxygen, they exhale it. They absorb solar energy. We radiate it. Plants were here long before we were, and have a totally different value system. Yet we‚Äôve managed to get along. . Plants were doing their thing long before we showed up to organize them. They catch solar energy and atmospheric water and molecules from the soil and transmute them all into the self-sustaining process called Life. This process, this gigantic DNA-based program, is constantly maintaining the appropriate temperature and oxygen level in the atmosphere. If it weren‚Äôt, life would have ceased to exist long ago. . We‚Äôre part of this computation too. Humans are ecological engineers. Like beavers or worms, we transform the world around us, creating niches for other forms of life. We form alliances with certain plants, and those plants thrive in symbiosis with our behavior. Plants that don‚Äôt get along humans, tend not to reproduce. . We alter ecosystems everywhere we go. Lately, we‚Äôve changed so many things, so quickly, that we‚Äôre in danger of crashing the whole system. . We were always already gardening algorithms. We‚Äôre just doing it badly. . What‚Äôs wrong with the way we‚Äôre doing algorithms now? . We‚Äôre growing the algorithms wrong, but that‚Äôs no surprise: we‚Äôre growing the plants wrong, too. Lined up like troops and fed a diet of petroleum products, the interconnected intelligence of the plant world is divided into dumb patches of monocrop. . Sure, at one point it was the best we could do. We have all these legacy technologies from the age of fossil fuels: physical machines, but also governments, markets, intellectual property, land ownership. Our current methods of farming were invented in a different time, when energy was cheap and communication was expensive. . If we started from scratch today, we would do both agriculture and computers differently. . For instance, permaculture tries to increase the number of connections between elements. The squash shades the roots of the corn, the corn grows a stalk for the bean to climb, the bean adds nitrogen to the soil for the squash and the corn. The focus is on relationships, instead of objects. . If we treated algorithms this way, we would think in terms of processes, not products. We would build rituals around the cycles of upgrades. Cultures would spring into life around different codebases. . In fact, this is happening. The open-source community is a vision of the future. The world is shifting to a new balance of power, where communication is cheap and energy is expensive. We will have to cooperate to survive; fortunately, when groups of people are interconnected, they‚Äôre more likely to cooperate. The free software available on the internet, and the millions of people who help build it, are evidence of that. . This is gardening: a community of people, sharing knowledge of a space, and the beings within it, and the way that they interrelate. . The farming mode of production is based on energy glut. It strips the ecosystem of all but the simplest variables, sucks a huge amount of fossil energy in one end, and squeezes food (and pollution) out the other. But that world is ending. In the future we have to make do with the amount of energy that hits the planet ‚Äî less, in fact, since so much energy must go to the plants to sustain the climate. . No longer can we simply reduce the variables and increase the power. We have to use all the information we‚Äôre gathering to increase the connections between each person and plant ‚Äî and computer. More connection means we wring more work out of each droplet of sun that hits the planet, before it floats off into space again. . In the transition to a high-information society, we will re-awaken the knowledge common to indigenous groups across the planet: Everything is connected to everything else. Life is a web of relationships. And in this awareness, we will garden our technologies. And our technologies will garden the world. . Thanks for reading. ‚Äî Max . . I love writing this newsletter.

            "content": "Last time I wrote last week about my background in the design system called¬†permaculture. I want to clarify: I don‚Äôt necessarily¬†like¬†permaculture. Or rather, I like the ideas behind it, and I like putting them into practice. But the name, and the subculture that goes along with it, are‚Ä¶ awkward, at best. . You might already have an idea of ‚Äúpermaculture‚Äù from your own experience. Or if you‚Äôve never heard of it before, you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúwhat an awkward (at best) word, what could it possibly mean?‚Äù In either case, I feel the need to explain. There are useful ideas hidden within the permaculture wrapper. . What is permaculture? . Permaculture grows out of the organic gardening movement in the 1970s. The founders are some white guys from Australia, who study food growing techniques from all over the world. They want to synthesize all these different methods from different environments into a scientific system that could be used anywhere. They can see that modern agriculture is damaging the earth: polluting the water, stripping the soil, burning irreplaceable fossil fuels and filling the sky with greenhouse gases. So they describe a design system for¬†permanent agriculture, or permaculture: a way of planning, building, and maintaining food production systems that work with, instead of against, nature. . What happened to it? Well, the original guys start teaching a Permaculture Design Course, It takes two weeks and gives you a piece of paper at the end that says you‚Äôre Certified to do Permaculture Design. Then they encourage other people to teach their own courses (although these days, due to degree inflation, you have to take a five-day Teacher Training as well). So unlike architecture, for instance, there‚Äôs no authority on who or what ‚Äúpermaculture‚Äù is. . As you can imagine, permaculture methods are not as profitable as modern agriculture methods. This is because agriculture dumps its problems on the rest of the world. Pollution, miserable wages and working conditions, and the climate emergency are all ‚Äúexternalities‚Äù that unsustainable agriculture doesn‚Äôt have to pay for. . So it‚Äôs easier to make a profit by selling the word ‚Äúpermaculture,‚Äù than by growing food in a sustainable way. And our world is built on profit. This quickly becomes a pyramid scheme, where I am a permaculture teacher and you pay me to teach you how to get paid to teach permaculture. Or would that make me a permaculture teacher teacher? Anyway, it‚Äôs a feedback loop, and not one of the good ones. . Now there‚Äôs all kinds of people teaching permaculture: grifters, hucksters, and shills; preppers, astrologers, and youtubers, on top of the core demographic: self-important white dudes with big hats. . Most of these people don‚Äôt actually think at a systems-design level. They usually remember one weird trick, like ‚Äúcontoured terraces‚Äù or ‚Äúearth building‚Äù, and specialize by teaching classes on that trick (and teaching classes on how to teach classes). I suspect that the general conception of permaculture is more ‚Äúcool techniques‚Äù than ‚Äúoverarching philosophy‚Äù. . What do we need from it? . Permaculture is a technology, and like any technology it has at its core a set of values. Unlike most of the technologies we use today, those values are explicit. They‚Äôre the three permaculture ethics: care for earth, care for people, and share the surplus. The last one is often the hardest. Most people can think of a natural environment they love, or a person they would do anything for. Sharing the surplus is harder to imagine. . We live in an era of intense greed. That is the unspoken value system behind the technologies that run the world: individual liberty, private property, corporate fiefdom. The alienation of the individual from the community is a¬†mistake¬†made by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Their hypothesis (and it is a hypothesis) that human nature is to be a single person making rational choices in your own best interest, is¬†falsified by the evidence. . We know now that we‚Äôre part of an ecological web. The land and the seas and the atmosphere are tranformed and maintained by all the organisms on the planet. We are not separate from animals or plants. We need them to live, and at this point, they need us too. . Most people don‚Äôt act like they live in the ecological web, though. We act like they live in a world of rational actors, even when our own behavior disproves that view. . And why not? The greed machine is everywhere, and everyone else is acting like it‚Äôs real too. Every piece of land in the world is Owned by someone, and they need to make a profit from it, because if they don‚Äôt, someone else will. Profit is greed in number form. . The technologies we interface with every day ‚Äî social media and artificial intelligence, sure, but also newspapers, TVs, factories, megastores, automobiles, freeways, air conditioning, tractors and farms ‚Äî are all built on this foundation of greed. This in turn changes the way we relate to the world. . The law of the instrument¬†says¬†if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. My corollary: if all you have is a profit motive, everything looks like it‚Äôs not nailed down. . If we built our societies and infrastructure on the permaculture ethics, instead of on personal gain, what kind of world could we live in? . We can get a hint from the world of free and open-source software. The biggest shifts in technology over my lifetime have germinated from projects like Linux and Wikipedia: massive collaborative efforts that generate shared wealth for everyone involved. This is surplus sharing in action, and it‚Äôs already changed the world. . Digital technologies move faster than infrastructure or cultural changes. The interface where technology shapes culture, is also the interface where culture shapes technology. This feedback loop means that any little change might be magnified hugely. The interface is a crucial leverage point. What values should it carry? . Thanks for reading, ‚Äî Max . . P.S.: I hope you‚Äôre enjoying Augmented Intelligence.

            "content": "Hello! This is the first issue of Augmented Intelligence, a newsletter about friendly computing. . I‚Äôm Max. I‚Äôm a whole-systems designer living in high desert New Mexico. In recent years I co-founded a bookstore and taught myself to code, but before that I was a builder of permaculture gardens. . The whole-systems philosophy of permaculture guides my approach to design. Whether I‚Äôm designing a business plan, a website or a food forest, I use ecological thinking to create productive, beautiful and resilient systems. . But this newsletter is not an advertisement for my services (I‚Äôm plenty busy ‚Äî who isn‚Äôt?). This newsletter is about interfaces. Specifically, the interface between humans and computers. . There are other interfaces, of course, wherever two domains touch. A garden is an interface between human and plant. A bookstore is an interface to the world of written thought. . Just because an interface works, however, does not mean that it fits well into the larger system. The dominant style of human-computer interface design is short-sighted and wasteful. Through the lens of whole-systems design, it looks like a system for making the maximum amount of human misery, at the greatest cost. . To understand why things are this way requires a grand vision for politics, economics, history and science, which I do not have. . What I do have is an obsessive interest in interface design, and your email address. Expect a weekly missive on the hows of interfaces: . How did these interfaces evolve, how do they work, and how can we make them better? . The name of this newsletter is a play on ‚Äúintelligence augmentation,‚Äù a computing concept coined in 1962 by Douglas Engelbart: . By ‚Äúaugmenting human intellect‚Äù we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. . ‚Äî Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework, Engelbert 1962 . Though gaining in popularity, this vision is still not realized. We build fake people ‚Äî ‚Äúartificial intelligences‚Äù ‚Äî and force them to be our ‚Äúassistants‚Äù, when we could be building tools that augment human intelligence. Humans could work with, not against, the machine. And the machines could work with us. A cybernetic meadow, where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony. . Thanks for reading, ‚Äî Max . . P.S.: If you got this in your inbox, you‚Äôre one of my very first subscribers ‚Äî a true friend. You might know more about any of this than I do, or you might have an outside perspective that I fail to see. . Write back whatever thoughts you have, even a quick sentence or a weird question.
